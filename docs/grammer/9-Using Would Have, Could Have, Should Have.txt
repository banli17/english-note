In this lesson, you can learn how to use would
have, should have and could have.
在本课程中，您可以学习如何使用“would
have”、“should have”和“could have”。

These verbs—would, should, could, etc.—are
modal verbs, so they don’t have past forms
这些动词——would、should、could等——是
情态动词，因此它们

like normal verbs do.
不像普通动词那样有过去形式。

Instead, you can talk about the past by adding
have plus a past participle after the verb.

decisions.

Try to think of something like this from your
past.

Now, ask yourself: you made the choices you
made.

所做的选择。

You passed the exam, or you failed it; you

你通过了考试，或者你没通过考试； 你
搬到了另一个国家，或者没有。

That’s reality, but what if things had gone

This is the imaginary past.
这就是想象中的过去。
