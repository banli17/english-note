In this lesson, you will learn the difference
between using "will" and "going to".
在本课程中，您将学习
使用“will”和“going to”之间的区别。

Both of these are used to talk about the future,
but they have slightly different meanings.
这两个词都用来谈论未来，
但含义略有不同。

Now, this lesson is part of the series on
English verb tenses created by www.engvid.com
现在，本课程是
www.engvid.com 创建的英语动词时态系列的一部分，

to help you improve your English fluency.
旨在帮助您提高英语流利程度。

Now, I have created lessons, separate individual
lessons on "will", which is the future simple,
现在，我已经创建了课程，分别
针对“will”（简单将来时）

and on "going to", and maybe you have watched
these, and if you have, that's great.
和“going to”进行了单独的课程，也许您已经看过
这些课程，如果您看过，那就太好了。

This will be a wonderful review and a way
for you to understand the differences more
这将是一个精彩的回顾，也是
您更

clearly, and if you have not watched the individual
lessons, that's also absolutely fine, you
清楚地理解差异的一种方式，如果您还没有观看过单独的
课程，那也绝对没问题，您

have watch this lesson now and this will give
you a wonderful overview and then you can
现在已经观看了本课程，这将为
您提供一个精彩的概述，然后您 可以

go and watch the individual lessons, alright?
去看个别课，好吗？

So, let's get started.
那么，让我们开始吧。

So, when we're talking about the future, we're
talking about any time after now, right?
所以，当我们谈论未来时，我们
谈论的是现在之后的任何时间，对吗？

Not the past, not the present, anytime after
now.
不是过去，不是现在，也不是以后的任何时候
。

And we can think about the future in many
different ways in English and we have many
我们可以
用英语以多种不同的方式思考未来，并且我们用许多

different tenses and expressions that we use
to talk about the future, but let's focus
不同的时态和表达方式
来谈论未来，但让我们关注

on these basic ways.
这些基本方式。

So, how do you know which one to use?
那么，您如何知道该使用哪一个呢？

You can think about it in a few days.
你可以过几天考虑一下。

First, think, is the situation formal or informal?
首先，思考一下，这种情况是正式的还是非正式的？

Because when you separate it like that, it
will help you to understand which one to use.
因为当你像这样分开它时，它将
帮助你了解该使用哪一个。

So, if the situation is formal, it's a formal,
official, business situation or academic situation,
所以，如果情况是正式的，那就是正式的、
官方的、商业的情况或学术的情况，

or even a social situation, alright?
甚至是社交的情况，好吗？

Formal and official means that you don't know
the people at all, or you know the people
正式和官方意味着你根本不认识
这些人，或者你

very well that you're speaking to, or you
don't know them very well, the ones you're
非常了解你正在交谈的人，或者你
不太了解他们，你正在

speaking to, or the ones you're writing to,
that would be more formal.
交谈的人，或者那些人 你写信给，
这样会更正式。

If that's the case, then you should always
use "will", alright?
既然如此，那你就应该
用“will”，好吗？

It's easy.
这很容易。

It doesn't matter about anything else, if
it's more formal, use "will" which is, in
别的没关系，如果
比较正式的话就用will，其实就是

fact, our future simple, it's also called
the future simple tense.
我们的一般将来时，也叫
一般将来时。

Now, if it's informal, you have a few choices.
现在，如果是非正式的，您有几个选择。

So, let's understand what that is.
那么，让我们了解那是什么。

So, if it's an informal situation, more casual,
more friendly, with people that you know,
所以，如果这是一个非正式的场合，更随意、
更友好，和你认识的人一起，

alright?
好吗？

Then you have to think a little bit further.
那你就得想得更远一点。

Is the situation that you're talking about
something that you planned in advance, or
你所说的情况是
你事先计划好的事情，还是

something that is not planned, that is unplanned?
没有计划的事情，是计划外的事情？

What does that mean?
这意味着什么？

You know, for example, if I need to see the
doctor, I usually can't just walk in, I need
你知道，例如，如果我需要看
医生，我通常不能直接走进去，我

to make an appointment, and something like
that, right?
需要预约，
诸如此类，对吗？

So, this is something that's planned.
所以，这是有计划的事情。

Or, if I'm going to travel somewhere, I need
to make the travel arrangements, make a reservation,
或者说，如果我要去某个地方旅行，我
需要安排旅行、订票、

buy the ticket, these are things that are
planned in advance, right?
买票，这些都是
提前计划好的事情，对吧？ 计划

And unplanned just means that you didn't plan
it before, you just sort of decided at that
外只是意味着你
之前没有计划，你只是在那

moment to do something.
一刻决定做某事。

Let's look at an example.
让我们看一个例子。

So, if it's planned, first of all, you're
going to use "going to", and if it's unplanned,
所以，如果是有计划的，首先你
要使用“going to”，如果没有计划，

you will use "will", or you'll use a contraction
with "will".
你会使用“will”，或者你会使用
“will”的缩写。

So, our example is this: let's say you're
at work and you see your colleague getting
所以，我们的例子是这样的：假设你
在工作，你看到你的同事

up and he's going somewhere and you say "Hey,
John, where are you going?" and he says "I'm
起床，他要去某个地方，你说“嘿，
约翰，你要去哪里？” 他说：“我

going to get some coffee."
要去喝点咖啡。”

Now, John has a plan.
现在，约翰有一个计划。

He got up for a reason.
他站起来是有原因的。

Why?
为什么？

To go and get some coffee.
去喝点咖啡。

So, it was planned.
所以，这是计划好的。

So, he says "I'm going to get", right?
所以，他说“我要去”，对吧？

Going to, this is our planned option, right?
去吧，这就是我们计划好的选择吧？

And then you say "Oh, you know what?
然后你说“哦，你知道吗？

I'll get some too.".
我也去买一些。”。

So, you say "Okay, I'll get some too."
所以，你说：“好吧，我也去买一些。”

Was your decision planned in advance?
你的决定是事先计划好的吗？

No, you just, you asked him, he was going
to get coffee and you say "Oh, okay, I'll
不，你只是，你问他，他要
去买咖啡，你说“哦，好吧，我

get some too."
也买一些。”

So, this is an example of the unplanned one,
alright?
所以，这是一个计划外的例子，
好吗？

Now, to understand a little more clearly the
formal one, okay, let's look at this example:
现在，为了更清楚地理解
正式的，好吧，让我们看这个例子：

it's an announcement, for example, at a conference.
这是一个公告，例如在一次会议上。

"Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the conference
at 9:00."
“女士们、先生们，我们将于9:00开始会议
。”

"We will".
“我们将”。

We will begin, right?
我们就开始吧？

It's very official and they're talking to
maybe hundreds of people or thousands of people,
这是非常官方的，他们可能正在与
数百人或数千人交谈，

it's a little more formal.
这有点正式。

So, that's the formal one, but here, we used
either "going to" or we used "will" for planned
所以，这是正式的，但在这里，我们使用
“going to”或“will”来表示计划内

or unplanned events.
或计划外的事件。

Now, let's take a quick look at the structure
of "will" and "going to".
现在，让我们快速浏览一下
“will”和“going to”的结构。

So, basically here, we're taking the subject,
I, you, we, they, etc., we're taking the word
所以，基本上在这里，我们采用主语，
我，你，我们，他们等，我们采用

"will" and then the base form of the verb.
“will”一词，然后是动词的基本形式。

That's it.
就是这样。

For example: I will work, You will work, We
will work, They will work, He will work, She
例如：我会工作，你会工作，我们
会工作，他们会工作，他会工作，她

will work, and It will work.
会工作，它会工作。

Okay?
好的？

That's when it's formal and you're using the
full form, but most of the time, if it's informal,
当它是正式的并且你使用
完整的形式时，但大多数时候，如果它是非正式的，

then we don't say all of that.
那么我们不会说所有这些。

We use a contraction.
我们使用缩写。

We say "I'll" instead of "I will".
我们说“我会”而不是“我会”。

I'll work.
我会工作。

You'll work.
你会工作的。

We'll work.
我们会工作。

They'll work.
他们会工作的。

He'll work.
他会工作。

She'll work, and It'll work, alright?
她会工作的，它会工作的，好吗？

Now, if we want to make it negative, like
any negative, we usually add the word "not".
现在，如果我们想让它变得否定，就像
任何否定一样，我们通常会添加“不”这个词。

I will not work tomorrow.
明天我不工作。

Or, if you want to shorten it, what would
it become?
或者，如果你想缩短它，
它会变成什么？

Won't.
惯于。

Not "will not", "I will not" is the full form,
okay?
不是“不会”，“我不会”才是完整形式，
好吗？

I will not, you will not work, etc., but when
you shorten it, you use this key word: won't.
我不会，你不会工作等等，但是当
你缩短它时，你使用这个关键词：不会。

So, "will not" becomes "won't".
所以，“不会”就变成了“不会”。

For example, "He won't work", alright?
例如，“他不会工作”，好吗？

She won't work.
她不会工作。

Make sure you're pronouncing it correctly
also.
确保你的发音
也正确。

And a question in this, in this future simple
tense, right, with "will", we would say "Will
一个问题，在这个将来简单时
态中，对，用“will”，我们会说“

he work?"
他会工作吗？”

Will they work?
他们会工作吗？

Will she work?
她会工作吗？

Alright?
好吧？

We're changing the order.
我们正在改变顺序。

And, of course, this is just a quick overview.
当然，这只是一个快速概述。

In the lesson that I have, which is all about
future simple, it's a full class on that,
在我的课程中，都是关于
简单将来时的，这是一门完整的课程，

and you'll learn exactly in the positive sentence,
in the negative sentence, in the question,
你将准确地学习肯定句、
否定句、问题

and all of the forms, you'll also have more
time to practice pronouncing each of these,
和所有形式，你将 还有更多的
时间练习这些发音，

okay?
好吗？

But this is the quick overview.
但这是快速概述。

Now, if we're using "going to", then what
do we do?
现在，如果我们使用“going to”，那么
我们该怎么办？

We have the subject, I, you, we, they, we
have the verb "to be", I am, you are, then
我们有主语，我，你，我们，他们，我们
有动词“to be”，我是，你是，然后

we have "going to", just as an expression,
just put in there, you don't have to change
我们有“going to”，就作为一个表达，
就放在那里，你不 必须改变

it, and then last, we have the verb in its
base form, okay?
它，最后，我们有动词的
基本形式，好吗？

So, in real - in reality, it will sound like
this: I'm going to.
所以，实际上——实际上，听起来会是
这样的：我要去。

Now here, because "going to" is the informal
version, you don't really need to say "I am
现在在这里，因为“going to”是非正式
版本，所以你实际上不需要说“I am

going to work tomorrow", you can just say
"I'm going to work", which is the contraction,
go to work Friday”，你可以只说
“I'm go to work”，这是缩写，

which is what we use in informal conversation.
这是 我们在非正式谈话中使用的内容。

Just like here, we use "I'll", here, we use
"I'm", alright?
就像这里，我们用“I'll”，这里，我们用
“I'm”，好吗？

So, these would sound like this: I'm going
to work.
所以，这些听起来像这样：我要去
工作。

You're going to work.
你要去工作了。

We're going to work tomorrow.
明天我们还要上班。

They're going to work.
他们要去工作了。

He's going to work, she's going to work, and
It's going to work.
他要工作，她要工作，
一切都会工作。

Alright?
好吧？

That's the basic structure.
这就是基本结构。

Now, if you want to make it negative, again,
we're going to add the word "not", but you
现在，如果你想再次使其变得消极，
我们将添加“不”这个词，但你

put it - you could do in two ways, okay?
说 - 你可以用两种方式来做，好吗？

With "I'm", it's just "I'm not going to work",
that's it, there's nothing else you can do.
有了“我”，就只是“我不去工作”，
仅此而已，你无能为力。

With these others, you can contract them in
different ways.
对于其他人，您可以通过
不同的方式与他们签约。

So, one way is to say the "not", right?
那么，一种方法就是说“不”，对吗？

You could say "You're not going to work",
or you could say "You aren't going to work",
你可以说“你不会去工作”，
或者你可以说“你不会去工作”，

alright?
好吗？

So, the easy way is to just put the "not"
there, okay, if you're not sure of how this
所以，最简单的方法就是把“不”放在
那里，好吧，如果你不确定这是如何

works, just say: You're not going to work,
He's not going to work, They're not going
运作的，就说：你不会工作，
他不会工作，他们不会

to work, alright?
去工作，好吗？

"Not" will always create that negative for
you.
“不”总是会给你带来负面影响
。

But, be aware that people will be using another
form as well, and you can, once you're comfortable
但是，请注意，人们也会使用另一种
形式，一旦您适应

with it, and it's like that.
了它，您就可以使用它，就像那样。

You aren't.
你不是。

We aren't.
我们不是。

They aren't.
他们不是。

Or, if it's for these three, you could say
"He's not going to work", that original form,
或者，如果是针对这三个人，您可以说
“他不会工作”，即原始形式，

or you could say "He isn't going to work",
okay?
或者您可以说“他不会工作”，
好吗？

So, those are some options that you have when
you're speaking.
所以，这些是你在演讲时可以有的一些选择
。

And then question would be, again, you're
reversing the order, so you say, "Is he going
然后问题又是，你要
颠倒顺序，所以你说，“他

to work tomorrow?", okay?
明天要去上班吗？”，好吗？

So, this is the basic structure that you have
to keep in mind.
因此，这是您必须牢记的基本结构
。

If you know it well, that's great.
如果你很了解它，那就太好了。

If you need review, then as I said, watch
the individual lessons afterwards so you really
如果你需要复习，那么就像我说的，
之后观看单独的课程，这样你才能真正

understand exactly how to use it, how to write
it, how to say it, without making any mistakes.
理解如何使用它，如何写
它，如何说它，而不犯任何错误。

Now, let's look at when to use "going to"
and "will" in a little more detail.
现在，让我们更详细地看看何时使用“going to”
和“will”。

You already know that if it's a formal situation,
then of course, we use which one?
你已经知道，如果是正式场合，
那么我们当然用哪一种呢？

We use "will".
我们用“意志”。

But if it's informal, let's look at some of
the points to keep in mind.
但如果是非正式的，让我们看看一些
需要记住的要点。

The most important point you've already learned:
is it something planned or something unplanned,
您已经学到的最重要的一点是：
这是计划好的事情还是计划外的事情，

right?
对吧？

That's the key, but let's look in a little
more detail.
这是关键，但让我们
更详细地看一下。

So, on this side is "going to", and on his
side is everything with "will".
所以，这边是“将”，而他
这边则是一切“将”。

So, just look at the main points.
所以，只看要点。

With "going to", we talk about planned things.
“去”，我们谈论计划好的事情。

With "will" - unplanned.
用“意志”——无计划的。

With "going to", something is certain.
“去”表示某件事是确定的。

With "will", it's uncertain.
有了“意志”，就不确定了。

With "going to", something is already decided.
“去”就表示某件事已经决定了。

With "will", you just decided at that moment.
有了“意志”，你就在那一刻决定了。

With "going to", again, it's certain, but
with "will", it's possible, okay?
再说一次，用“going to”，这是确定的，但
用“will”，这是可能的，好吗？

So, let's understand these first in a little
more detail.
因此，让我们首先更详细地了解这些
。

So, an example of planned is "I'm going to
call Jim at 3:00."
因此，计划的一个例子是“我要
在 3:00 给吉姆打电话”。

It's in my - it's on the agenda, it's in my
diary, I have to call him at 3:00, it's a
它在我的——它在议程上，它在我的
日记里，我必须在 3:00 给他打电话，这是一个

planned activity, okay?
计划好的活动，好吗？

But, an example of the unplanned one, let's
say somebody tells you "Oh, while you were
但是，举一个意外的例子，
假设有人告诉你“哦，当你

out, Jim called you.", so you say "Okay, I'll
call him in a few minutes."
出去的时候，吉姆打电话给你。”，所以你说“好吧，我
几分钟后给他打电话。”

You just decided that.
你刚刚决定了。

You didn't have it as part of your plan for
the day.
你没有把它作为你当天计划的一部分
。

It just happened, it was an unplanned thing,
okay?
事情就这么发生了，这是一件没有计划的事情，
好吗？

Next, an example of something certain: "We're
going to visit Spain next month."
接下来，举一个特定的例子：“我们
下个月要去西班牙。”

If you're going to travel, you need to make
reservations, buy your tickets, pay the money,
如果你要去旅行，你需要
预订、买票、付钱，

all that, right?
所有这些，对吗？

So, this is certain.
所以，这是肯定的。

We're going to visit Spain next month.
下个月我们要去西班牙。

We've made the necessary arrangements.
我们已经做了必要的安排。

An example of uncertain: "We'll probably visit
Spain next month.", but we're not sure yet,
不确定的例子：“我们下个月可能会访问
西班牙。”，但我们还不确定，

okay?
好吗？

So, you see here, it's "we'll probably", right?
所以，你看这里，这是“我们可能会”，对吗？

And here, "I'll call him".
在这里，“我会打电话给他”。

Here: "I'm going to" do this.
这里：“我要”这样做。

"We're going to visit Spain", okay?
“我们要去西班牙”，好吗？

You see that "going to" and "will" appearing
in each case.
您会看到“going to”和“will”出现
在每种情况下。

Next, if something is already decided, which
is really another way of saying what?
接下来，如果某件事已经决定了，这
实际上是另一种表达方式？ 是

It's planned, right?
计划好的吧？

They're just different ways, and in many of
the textbooks, you will see sometimes long
它们只是不同的方式，在许多
教科书中，有时您会看到很长的

lists which explain which one to use when.
列表，解释何时使用哪一种。

I don't think you need to think about it in
that much detail, if it helps you, great,
我认为你不需要考虑
那么详细，如果它对你有帮助，那就太好了，

but I've tried to bring it down to the few
basic points that you need to understand to
但我试图把它简化为
你做出这个选择时需要理解的几个基本点

make this choice, and really, it's up here
in the planned and unplanned, this is just
，而且真的， 这是
计划内和计划外的，这只是

a little more detail to help you really get
it, okay?
帮助您真正实现它的更多细节
，好吗？

So, if something is already decided, you could
say "I'm going to have lunch at noon."
所以，如果事情已经决定了，你可以
说“我中午要吃午饭”。

It's in the diary, you've scheduled it, because
after that you have a meeting, okay, so you
日记里有，你已经安排好了，因为
之后你要开会，好吧，所以你

have already decided.
已经决定了。

But here, just decided, in the sense that,
at this moment, so you say "You know what,
但在这里，刚刚决定，从某种意义上说，
此时此刻，所以你说“你知道吗，

I'm kind of hungry.
我有点饿了。

I think I'll have lunch now."
我想我现在就吃午饭了。”

So, you just decided at that moment.
所以，你在那一刻就决定了。

It wasn't part of something you had already
decided.
这不是你已经决定的事情的一部分
。

Next, when something is certain, for example:
"He's going to get the test results today.",
接下来，当事情确定时，例如：
“他今天将得到测试结果。”，

because today is the 15th and they said that
all of the Math exam results are expected
因为今天是 15 号，他们说
所有数学考试结果都预计在

today.
今天。

So, he's going to get the test results today,
alright?
那么，他今天就要拿到检查结果，
好吗？

That's something certain.
这是肯定的事情。

Or, on this side with "will", it's possible.
或者说，这边加上“意志”，也是有可能的。

"I believe he'll pass the test."
“我相信他会通过考验。”

I don't know, he's supposed to get the results,
he's a pretty good student, I believe he'll
我不知道，他应该会得到结果，
他是一个非常好的学生，我相信他会

pass the test, but it's possible, okay, we
don't know for sure.
通过测试，但有可能，好吧，我们
不确定。

Here, we know for sure.
在这里，我们确信无疑。

Okay?
好的？

So, these are some of the points to keep in
mind when you have to choose this one or that
因此，
当您必须选择这个或那个

one.
时，请记住以下几点。

But, there is one situation in particular
where you can use either one, alright?
但是，有一种特别的情况，
你可以使用其中任何一种，好吗？

And that's when you're predicting something.
这就是你预测某事的时候。

You're making a prediction.
你正在做出预测。

You're saying what you think will happen or
what someone says will happen.
你说的是你认为会发生的事情或者
别人说会发生的事情。

For example: "The weather channel says it's
going to snow tomorrow."
例如：“天气频道说明
天会下雪。”

Right?
正确的？

"It's going to snow", you could say that,
or you could just as well say "The weather
“要下雪了”，你可以这样说，
或者你也可以说“天气

channel says it'll snow tomorrow."
频道说明天会下雪”。

"It'll snow" - It will snow tomorrow, okay?
“明天会下雪”——明天会下雪，好吗？

So, for predictions, you could actually use
either one, and another thing to keep in mind,
因此，对于预测，您实际上可以使用
其中之一，但要记住另一件事，

it's wonderful that you're learning these
differences because they can make a big difference,
您正在学习这些差异真是太好了，
因为它们可以产生很大的差异，

alright, to exactly communicating the message
that you want to communicate about whether
好吧，准确地传达
您想要传达的信息 不管

something is planned or not, but don't panic
over it, okay?
某件事是否是计划好的，但不要
为此惊慌，好吗？

Take it easy, because whether you say "going
to" or whether you say "will", both of them
放轻松，因为无论你说“
打算”还是说“将”，它们都

refer to the future.
指的是未来。

So, definitely nobody's going to think that
you're talking about the past, so they will
所以，绝对没有人会认为
你在谈论过去，所以他们会

understand that you're talking about the future,
but of course, if you want to communicate
理解你在谈论未来，
但是当然，如​​果你想

more fluently and at a more advanced level,
for an exam or when you're writing a report
更流利地交流，达到更高级的水平，
为了考试 或者当您撰写报告

or making a presentation, then you want to
be more precise, and that's why we're going
或进行演示时，您想要
更精确，这就是为什么我们要

into this in a little more detail.
更详细地讨论这一点。

Now, let's look at a special situation where
you could actually use both "going to" and
现在，让我们看一下一种特殊情况，在这种情况下，
您实际上可以在同一个句子中同时使用“going to”和

"will" in the same sentence.
“will”。

Let's see how it works.
让我们看看它是如何工作的。

So, let's suppose that your friend asks you
"What are you doing tonight?" and there are
所以，假设你的朋友问你
“你今晚在做什么？” 当你确定的时候，

some things that you're going to do tonight
when you're sure of.
今晚你会做一些事情
。

You have plan, you're certain, you've decided,
and there are some other thing which you're
你有计划，你确定，你已经决定，
还有一些其他事情你

unsure about.
不确定。

You haven't decided yet, you aren't certain,
you don't have the plan yet.
你还没有决定，你还不确定，
你还没有计划。

It's possible.
这是有可能的。

These are certain, right?
这些都是确定的吧？

So, you could say something like this: "I'm
going to study for my exam", you know that,
所以，你可以这样说：“我
要为考试而学习”，你知道，

you have a plan, "and then maybe", uncertain,
"and then maybe I'll watch a show.", okay?
你有一个计划，“然后也许”，不确定，
“然后也许我会看一场演出。”  ， 好的？

Let's read that again: I'm going to study
for my exam and then maybe I'll watch a show.
让我们再读一遍：我要
为考试而学习，然后也许我会看一场演出。

So, this person has something which is sure
- studying for the exam, and something which
那么，这个人有一些确定的东西
——准备考试，还有一些

is unsure - and that uncertain part is indicated
in two ways, with the word "maybe", right?
不确定的东西——而不确定的部分
有两种方式表示，用“也许”这个词，对吧？

We don't know for sure, and with "I'll", okay?
我们不确定，但“我会”，好吗？

But we see here: I'll watch, and we see here:
going to study.
但我们在这里看到：我会观看，我们在这里看到：
去学习。

I'm going to study.
我要去学习。

Okay?
好的？

So, it's possible that in one sentence that
you have both because you have something that's
所以，有可能在一句话中
你同时拥有这两种情况，因为你有一些

planned and something unplanned.
计划内的事情和一些计划外的事情。

It's still comes down to that basic planned/unplanned
difference, okay?
这仍然归结为基本的计划/计划外
差异，好吗？

Let's look at one more example.
让我们再看一个例子。

So, let's say you're planning a trip and your
friend asks you "So, what are you doing tonight?"
假设您正在计划一次旅行，而您的
朋友问您“那么，您今晚要做什么？”

and you have some plans and some things you're
not sure about.
你有一些计划和一些你
不确定的事情。

So, you say "I'm going to pack my suitcases"
- this is a plan - "and then maybe I'll meet
所以，你说“我要收拾行李”
——这是一个计划——“然后也许我会和

some friends for dinner.", okay?
一些朋友一起吃晚饭。”，好吗？

So again, we have here "I'll meet", "maybe
I'll meet", so we have this combination of
再说一次，我们这里有“我会见面”、“也许
我会见面”，所以我们有

sure and unsure.
确定和不确定的组合。

Let's read it one last time: I'm going to
pack my suitcases and then maybe I'll meet
让我们最后读一遍：我要
收拾行李，然后也许我会和

some friends for dinner.
一些朋友一起吃晚饭。

Okay?
好的？

So, again, you could see this combination
and maybe right now you can ask yourself or
所以，再一次，你可以看到这种组合
，也许现在你可以问自己，或者

if I ask you "What are you doing tonight?"
如果我问你“你今晚在做什么？”

Tell me something you know for sure, and tell
me something you're not sure about, okay?
告诉我一些你确定知道的事情，告诉
我一些你不确定的事情，好吗？

And one last point: Did you notice that, in
this question, I said "What are you doing
最后一点：你是否注意到，在
这个问题中，我说“你今晚在做什么

tonight?", so that is the other way that we
have using the present continuous for the
？”，所以这是我们
使用现在进行

future, alright, which is, again, something
that I've covered in the individual lesson
将来时的另一种方式，好吧，这又是一些东西
我在

on "going to" and present continuous.
关于“去”和现在进行时的单独课程中已经介绍过。

Now, let's practice what you've learned.
现在，让我们练习一下您所学的内容。

So, remember you're either going to use "going
to" or "will".
所以，请记住，您要么要使用“going
to”，要么要使用“will”。

So, the first one is something certain: I
__________ work on Friday.
所以，第一个问题是确定的：我
周五工作。

What would you say?
你会说什么？

I'm going to work on Friday, because it's
certain.
周五我要去工作，因为这是
确定的。

The second one is uncertain: Maybe I ________
work on Friday.
第二个不确定：也许我
周五工作。

What should it be?
应该是什么？

Maybe I'll work on Friday.
也许周五我会工作。

Okay?
好的？

Alright.
好吧。

Good.
好的。

Number two - number three.
第二-第三。

Here, something is decided already, so: He
________ study medicine.
在这里，有些事情已经决定了，所以：他
________学习医学。

What should it be?
应该是什么？

He's going to study medicine.
他要学医。

And number four, it's not decided yet.
第四，尚未决定。

It's undecided: He __________ study law or
medicine.
尚未决定：他 __________ 学习法律或
医学。

What will that be?
那会是什么？

He'll - as in, he will, He will study law
or medicine, because it's still undecided.
他会——就像，他会，他会学习法律
或医学，因为它还没有决定。

Okay?
好的？

Alright, number five, something unplanned:
They _________ probably get married.
好吧，第五，一些计划外的事情：
他们可能会结婚。

It's unplanned, not planned yet, so what would
we say?
这是计划外的，还没有计划，所以
我们会说什么？

They'll.
他们会的。

They'll probably get married.
他们很可能会结婚。

But now, in number six, it's planned, so what
do we say now?
但现在，第六项已经计划好了，那么
我们现在说什么？

They _________ get married.
他们_________结婚了。

What would it be?
会是什么？

They're going to get married.
他们要结婚了。

Okay?
好的？

Very nice.
很不错。

Number seven, this is formal: The Prime Minister
________ arrive at 8:00pm.
第七，这是正式的：总理
________ 于晚上 8:00 到达。

Which one will it be?
会是哪一个呢？

The Prime Minister will arrive at 8:00pm,
because this is formal.
总理将于晚上 8:00 抵达，
因为这是正式的。

Number eight is informal.
第八个是非正式的。

So, what would we say here?
那么，我们在这里要说什么呢？

My friend _________ come over at 8:00pm.
我的朋友 _________ 晚上 8:00 过来。

My friend is - or you could say: My friend's
going to come over at 8:00pm, okay?
我的朋友 - 或者你可以说：我的朋友
晚上 8:00 过来，好吗？

So, it would be like this, it's one friend,
so that would be "friend's".
所以，就像这样，这是一个朋友，
所以那就是“朋友的”。

Now, number nine and number ten are both predictions,
so what happens there?
现在，第九和第十都是预测，
那么那里会发生什么呢？

Do you remember?
你是否记得？

So, with predictions, we could say either
one.
因此，根据预测，我们可以说
其中之一。

So, number nine: She __________ win the election.
所以，第九点：她 __________ 赢得了选举。

So, we could say: She's going to win the election,
or here also: She _________ the election.
所以，我们可以说：她将赢得选举，
或者这里也可以说：她_________选举。

We could say: She'll win the election, as
in, she will win the election.
我们可以说：她将赢得选举，就像
她将赢得选举一样。

So, whether it's - if it's a prediction, you
can use either "going to" or "will".
所以，无论是 - 如果是预测，你
可以使用“going to”或“will”。

Alright?
好吧？

So, I hope this review helped you to reinforce
what you've been learning and where can you
所以，我希望这篇评论能帮助您巩固所
学知识以及

接下来可以做什么？

If you'd like to do a little more review on
each of these, on the "going to", on the "will",
如果你想对
每一个“要去”、“将”做更多的复习，
