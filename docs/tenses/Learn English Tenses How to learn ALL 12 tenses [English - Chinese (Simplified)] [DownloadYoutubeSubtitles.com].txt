of all of the English tenses.
在本视频中，我将向您概述
所有英语时态。

And I'm going to show you a special way to
understand them so that you can learn them
我将向您展示一种
理解它们的特殊方法，以便您可以

more easily.
更轻松地学习它们。

So, this video is part of the www.engvid.com
series on English verb tenses.
因此，该视频是 www.engvid.com
英语动词时态系列的一部分。

But what are tenses anyway?
但到底什么是时态呢？

Tenses are just the way we refer to time in
a language.
时态就是我们在语言中表示时间的方式
。

We could be talking about the past or the
present or the future.
我们可以谈论过去、
现在或未来。

In English, there are twelve different tenses,
and they can be explained in many different
英语中有十二种不同的时态，
可以用多种不同的方式解释它们

ways, but I'm going to show you a simple way
that I think will make it much easier for
，但我将向您展示一种简单的方法，
我认为这将使您更容易

you to learn, understand, and start using
them.
学习、理解和开始使用
它们。

So, let's have a look.
那么，让我们来看看吧。

So, on the board, I've written the twelve
tenses.
所以，我在黑板上写下了十二种
时态。

In red are the names of the tenses, and in
black is an example each time of that tense.
红色是时态的名称，
黑色是该时态的每次示例。

Alright?
好吧？

But right now, you don't have to worry about
that.
但现在，你不必担心
这个。

This is just to give you the big picture,
alright?
这只是为了让您了解全局，
好吗？

But don't worry if you don't know the names
of these tenses or the examples.
但如果您不知道
这些时态的名称或示例，请不要担心。

It doesn't matter at all.
完全没关系。

Once we begin the program, you will be learning
one tense at a time and you'll learn everything
一旦我们开始该计划，您将一次学习
一种时态，

you need to know when you get to that tense.
当您学习该时态时，您将学到您需要知道的一切。

Alright?
好吧？

So, what do we need to see here, though, that
is helpful to us?
那么，我们需要在这里看到什么
对我们有帮助的呢？

So, even though there are twelve tenses, I've
divided them in a particular way.
因此，尽管有十二种时态，但我还是
以特定的方式对它们进行了划分。

The first six are what I call the basic tenses.
前六个是我所说的基本时态。

Because usually, these are the ones you learn
first when you start learning English.
因为通常，这些是
你开始学习英语时首先学习的。

The second part, the second six tenses are
more advanced tenses.
第二部分，后六个时态是
比较高级的时态。

Usually, you start learning those a little
bit later.
通常，您会稍后开始学习这些内容
。

That's the first part.
这是第一部分。

Now, let's look at it this way.
现在，让我们这样看。

On this side, we see simple tenses.
在这一边，我们看到简单时态。

On this side, we see continuous tenses, which
are sometimes called progressive tenses.
在这一边，我们看到进行时态，
有时称为进行时态。

But all those names, simple, continuous, doesn't
matter right now.
但所有这些简单、连续的名字
现在都不重要了。

Because when you get to that tense, you'll
understand it.
因为当你达到那种时态时，你就会
明白。

What is important, though, is that many of
the patterns and rules that you'll learn here
但重要的是，
您将在这里学到的许多模式和规则

will help you throughout this part of the
tenses.
将帮助您完成这部分时
态。

And many of the rules and patterns about grammar,
pronunciation, and spelling that you learn
您

right here with this continuous tense will
help you all the way through to the most advanced
在这里用这种进行时态学习的许多关于语法、发音和拼写的规则和模式将
帮助您一直到最高级的

tense.
时态。

What does that mean for you?
这对你来说意味着什么？

It means that, as you go forward in this program,
from the beginner tenses and the more basic
这意味着，当您继续学习本课程时，
从初级时态和更基本的

tenses to the more advanced tenses.
时态到更高级的时态。

It's not - everything is not going to get
harder.
事实并非如此——一切都不会变得
更困难。

Many of the points will actually become easier,
because you will already have learned them
许多要点实际上会变得更容易，
因为你已经

up here in the basic tenses, or here, because
many of these, as you can see - actually all
在这里以基本时态学习了它们，或者在这里，因为
其中许多，正如你所看到的 - 实际上

of them have some sort of continuous aspect,
which you will understand completely when
它们都有某种连续的方面，
你会 当

you get there.
你到达那里时就完全理解了。

Okay?
好的？

So, that's the most important points that
I think you should take away right now from
所以，这是
我认为你现在应该从中领悟的最重要的一点

this.
。

All you need to do at this point now is to
begin the program with the first tense, which
现在您需要做的就是
以第一个时态开始程序，

is the present simple tense.
即现在简单时态。

So I wish you all the best.
所以我祝你一切顺利。
