Welcome to this class on the past continuous
tense, which is also called the past progressive
欢迎来到这堂关于过去进行时的
课程，这也称为过去进行

tense.
时。

Now, this class is part of the series created
by EngVid to help you learn and start using
现在，本课程是 EngVid 创建的系列的一部分，
旨在帮助您一一学习并开始使用

all of the English verb tenses one by one.
所有英语动词时态。

So, the past continuous tense is used quite
often in English, so let's understand exactly
因此，过去进行时
在英语中使用得非常频繁，所以让我们准确地了解

when to use it and how to use it.
何时使用它以及如何使用它。

Are you ready?
你准备好了吗？

Let's begin.
让我们开始吧。

So, when we want to talk about the past in
English, there are two basic tenses: the past
所以，当我们想用英语谈论过去时时
，有两种基本时态：一般过去时

simple and the past continuous.
和过去进行时。

An example of the past simple is "I worked".
过去简单的一个例子是“Iworking”。

An example of past continuous is "I was working".
过去进行时的一个例子是“我正在工作”。

So, let's understand the difference.
那么，让我们了解其中的区别。

When we use the past simple, we are referring
to something that happened at a specific point
当我们使用简单过去时，我们指的是
在特定时间点发生的事情

in time, okay?
，好吗？

It happened at a specific point in time in
the past.
它发生在过去的某个特定时间点
。

When we use past continuous, we're talking
about something that continued during a period
当我们使用过去进行时时，我们
谈论的是过去一段时间内持续的事情

in the past, okay?
，好吗？

Here, we're just talking about the one action,
here, we're talking about the action that
在这里，我们只是谈论一个动作，
在这里，我们谈论的是

continued, how long it continued, and we want
to emphasize that, okay?
持续的动作，持续了多长时间，我们想
强调这一点，好吗？

Let's look at an example here with our timeline.
让我们看一个带有时间线的示例。

So, let's say this is our timeline.
所以，假设这是我们的时间表。

This is now, and it's 8:00pm.
现在是晚上 8:00。 现在

It's 8:00 in the evening, alright?
是晚上 8:00 好吗？

And let's say that in the past, before this,
you were working, okay?
假设过去，在此之前，
你在工作，好吗？

So, let's say you started work - let's say,
you could say "I started work at 9:00am."
因此，假设您开始工作 - 假设
您可以说“我在上午 9:00 开始工作”。

Started - I started, past simple.
开始 - 我开始了，过去的简单。

"I finished work at 5:00pm.", again, past
simple, because these are points, right?
“我下午 5:00 完成工作。”，再一次，
简单地说，因为这些都是要点，对吗？

9:00am is a point, 5:00pm is a point.
上午 9:00 为一个点，下午 5:00 为一个点。

I started, I finished, that's past simple.
我开始了，我完成了，这已经很简单了。

But, if you want to talk about this period
from 9:00am to 5:00pm, and you want to emphasize
但是，如果您想谈论
从上午 9:00 到下午 5:00 的这段时间，并且您想强调

that it went on for some time, then you would
say "I was working from 9:00am to 5:00pm.",
它持续了一段时间，那么您会
说“我从上午 9:00 工作到下午 5:00”。  ，

and this "I was working" is the past continuous,
alright?
而这个“我正在工作”是过去进行时，
好吗？

That's the basic explanation of it.
这就是它的基本解释。

Now, let's look at how we form it.
现在，让我们看看如何形成它。

So, we would use the subject + the past tense
of the verb "to be" as the helping verb, then
因此，我们将使用主语 +
动词“to be”的过去式作为助动词，然后使用

a verb + -ing.
动词 + -ing。

For example, we would say: I was working.
例如，我们会说：我正在工作。

He was working.
他正在工作。

She was working.
她正在工作。

It was working.
它正在工作。

Then it changes a little bit, see here?
然后它发生了一点变化，看到这里了吗？

You were working.
你当时正在工作。

We were working, and They were working.
我们在工作，他们也在工作。

Alright?
好吧？

So, that's your basic overview of the past
continuous tense.
这就是过去进行时的基本概述
。

Now, let's look at when we can use the past
continuous tense.
现在，让我们看看什么时候可以使用过去
进行时。

So, we can use it to talk about an action
that was continuing during a period of time.
因此，我们可以用它来谈论
一段时间内持续的动作。

For example: Sarah was studying all day.
例如：莎拉整天都在学习。

What's the period of time here in this sentence?
这句话中的时间段是多少？

All day.
一整天。

And where's our past continuous?
我们的过去进行时在哪里？

Here: "was studying", okay?
这里：“正在学习”，好吗？

Next, we can also use this tense to talk about
an action that was continuing during a particular
接下来，我们还可以使用这个时态来谈论过去
某个特定时刻正在持续的动作

moment in the past.
。

For example: At 11:00pm, I was sleeping.
例如：晚上 11:00，我正在睡觉。

What's the moment in the past?
过去的时刻是什么？

11:00pm.
晚上 11:00。

Where is our past continuous?
我们的过去的连续性在哪里？

Here, okay?
在这里，好吗？

So, when would you say something like that?
那么，你什么时候会说这样的话呢？

Well, let's suppose somebody said "Oh, I tried
to call you last night, but you didn't answer."
好吧，假设有人说“哦，我
昨晚想给你打电话，但你没有接听。”

And you say, "What time?" and they said "Oh,
around 11:00."
你说：“什么时间？” 他们说：“哦，
11:00 左右。”

And you say "Oh, at 11:00pm, I was sleeping."
你说“哦，晚上 11:00，我正在睡觉。”

Okay?
好的？

Like that.
就这样。

Next, we can also use it to talk about an
action that was continuing when it was interrupted
接下来，我们还可以用它来谈论一个被另一个动作
打断时仍在继续的动作

by another action.
。

For example: They were having dinner when
we arrived.
例如：我们到达时他们正在吃晚饭
。

Now, this is an interesting sentence because
it actually has two past tenses.
现在，这是一个有趣的句子，因为
它实际上有两个过去时。

It has the past continuous: were having, right?
它有过去进行时：werehaving，对吧？

This was continuing, they were having dinner,
having and having and having dinner when we
这种情况还在继续，当我们到达时，他们正在吃晚饭、
吃晚饭、吃晚饭

arrived.
。

So, this part here is that past simple.
所以，这部分已经很简单了。

So, this action was continuing and then something
happened in the middle, but when you want
所以，这个动作是持续的，然后
中间发生了一些事情，但是当你想

to show that that something happened, you
want to show what was going on at that time,
表明某件事发生了，你
想表明当时发生了什么，

we use our past continuous.
我们使用过去进行时。

They were having dinner when we arrived.
我们到达时他们正在吃晚饭。

So, those are the three basic ways in which
we use this tense.
这些是
我们使用这种时态的三种基本方式。

But, there are a couple of advanced ways.
但是，有一些高级方法。

Let me just explain to you what they are.
让我向您解释一下它们是什么。

So, we can also use it sometimes to talk about
an action that was planned.
因此，我们有时也可以用它来谈论
计划好的行动。

For example: I was planning to call John,
okay?
例如：我打算给约翰打电话，
好吗？

I was thinking about it, I was planning to
call John, but I didn't have time.
我正在想，我打算给
约翰打电话，但我没有时间。

Okay?
好的？

So, that means that, at some time in the past,
you were thinking about that.
所以，这意味着，在过去的某个时候，
你正在考虑这个问题。

You were planning that, so that's where we
use that past continuous: I was planning to
你正在计划这样做，所以这就是我们
使用过去进行时的地方：我打算

call John, but I didn't have time.
打电话给约翰，但我没有时间。

I didn't have time is, once again, our past
simple, because that's just at a particular
我没有时间，再一次，我们的
简单过去时，因为那只是在一个特定的

point, but the planning or the thinking continued
and was continuing and therefore we're using
点，但计划或思考仍在继续，
并且正在继续，因此我们正在使用

past continuous.
过去进行时。

You could also use this tense sometimes for
a polite request with a particular expression
有时，您也可以使用这种时态来表示
礼貌的请求，并

that we use in English to make a polite request,
and that expression is this one: I was wondering
使用我们在英语中用于提出礼貌请求的特定表达方式，
该表达方式就是这样的：我想知道

if you could help me.
您是否可以帮助我。

When we say, "I was wondering", that is past
continuous, alright, here, but it's just an
当我们说“我想知道”时，这是过去
进行时，好吧，在这里，但这只是

expression that we use and it means, really,
you know, "Can you help me?
我们使用的一个表达方式，它的意思是，真的，
你知道，“你能帮助我吗？

Could you help me?", but it's a very polite
way of saying "I was wondering if you could
你能帮助我吗？”，但是 这是一种非常礼貌的
方式，可以表达“我想知道你是否可以

help me."
帮助我”。

That means I was thinking about this, if you
could help me, alright?
这意味着我正在考虑这个问题，如果你
能帮助我，好吗？

So, these are the basic ways in which we can
use this tense.
所以，这些是我们
使用这种时态的基本方式。

Now, let's look at when not to use the past
continuous tense.
现在，让我们看看什么时候不应该使用过去
进行时。

So, in English, we have two kinds of verbs:
action verbs and stative verbs.
因此，在英语中，我们有两种动词：
动作动词和静态动词。

Action verbs are verbs like work, study, run,
cook, clean, okay?
动作动词是指工作、学习、跑步、
做饭、清洁等动词，好吗？

And stative verbs describe some kind of state
or condition.
静态动词描述某种状态
或条件。

It could be a mental state, an emotional state,
or something else.
它可能是一种精神状态，一种情绪状态，
或者其他什么。

Let's look at some examples.
让我们看一些例子。

Now, what's important is that with these stative
verbs, with many of the stative verbs, we
现在，重要的是，对于这些静态
动词，对于许多静态动词，我们

cannot use them with this continuous tense
or any of the continuous tenses.
不能将它们与这种连续时态
或任何连续时态一起使用。

Let's look at an example.
让我们看一个例子。

It is wrong to say: I was knowing him for
many years.
说：我认识他
很多年是错误的。

Because "know" is a stative verb which we
cannot use in this way.
因为“知道”是一个静态动词，我们
不能这样使用。

So, this is wrong.
所以，这是错误的。

It is wrong to say, "Susan was hating spiders.",
because "hate" is one of those emotional stative
说“苏珊讨厌蜘蛛”是错误的，
因为“讨厌”是情感静态

verbs, and we cannot use it in the continuous
form.
动词之一，我们不能以进行时形式使用它
。

It is also wrong to use a verb which describes
ownership or possession or something that
使用描述
所有权、占有或

you have.
您拥有的东西的动词也是错误的。

For example, it's wrong to say, "They were
owning a big house.".
例如，说“他们
拥有一座大房子”是错误的。

We cannot say that, okay?
我们不能这么说，好吗？

Also, these two very common verbs, it's incorrect
to use them in the continuous form.
另外，这两个非常常见的动词，
用进行时形式是不正确的。

"We were wanting to call you.", nope, we can't
say that.
“我们想给你打电话。”，不，我们不能
这么说。

"She was needing to catch her flight.", no,
that's wrong, we cannot say that correctly,
“她需要赶飞机。”，不，
这是错误的，我们不能正确地说，

okay?
好吗？

Now, let's just go back for a second and look
at these.
现在，让我们回过头来看看
这些。

So, in this case, what would we use instead?
那么，在这种情况下，我们会用什么来代替呢？

We would have to just use the past simple.
我们必须只使用过去简单。

For example, we would say here: I knew him
for many years.
例如，我们会在这里说：我认识他
很多年了。

She hated spiders.
她讨厌蜘蛛。

They owned a big house.
他们拥有一栋大房子。

We wanted to call you.
我们想给你打电话。

She needed to catch her flight.
她需要赶飞机。

Those are all examples of past simple.
这些都是过去简单的例子。

We cannot use these continuous forms here
with the stative verbs.
我们不能在这里将这些连续形式
与静态动词一起使用。

There is one verb which is very interesting
and very common which you should be aware
有一个动词非常有趣
且非常常见，您应该注意

of, and that's the verb "to have".
，那就是动词“拥有”。

Now, "to have", sometimes has a stative meaning
and sometimes it has a more dynamic meaning,
现在，“拥有”有时具有静态含义
，有时具有更动态的含义

or action meaning.
或动作含义。

So, when it has a stative meeting, we cannot
use it in this tense or in any continuous
因此，当它有静态会议时，我们不能
以这种时态或任何进行时态使用它

tense, but when it has the other meaning,
then we can.
，但当它有其他含义时，
我们就可以。

Let's look at one example.
让我们看一个例子。

It is wrong to say, "He was having a computer".
说“他有一台电脑”是错误的。

No, we would have to say, "He had a computer.",
right?
不，我们不得不说，“他有一台电脑。”，
对吗？

Past simple.
过去简单。

But you could talk about something like this:
He was having a party.
但你可以谈论这样的事情：
他正在举办一个聚会。

He was having a good time.
他玩得很开心。

He was having fun.
他玩得很开心。

This is okay.
这没关系。

So, you have to pay attention to that verb
"to have", but what's the general take away
所以，你必须注意动词
“拥有”，但是这里的一般要点是什么

here?
？

Don't use stative verbs with this tense.
不要使用这种时态的静态动词。

Now, let's look at the structure of the past
continuous tense.
现在，我们来看看过去进行时的结构
。

So, we will look at it in a positive sentence,
a negative sentence, and a question.
所以，我们会用肯定句、
否定句和疑问句来看待它。

So, in the positive sentence, the basic way
we form this tense is we take the subject
因此，在肯定句中，
我们形成这种时态的基本方式是用主语

+ the verb "to be" in the past tense, which
is going to be "was" or "were" + the verb
+过去时态的动词“to be”，
即“was”或“were”+动词

+ -ing.
+-ing。

Let's look at how that works, okay?
让我们看看它是如何工作的，好吗？

So, I, He, She, or It, we would say "was working".
所以，我、他、她或它，我们会说“正在工作”。

I was working.
我正在工作。

You can repeat it after me so you start to
get used to it.
你可以跟着我重复一遍，这样你就开始
习惯了。

I was working yesterday.
我昨天正在工作。

He was working.
他正在工作。

She was working.
她正在工作。

It was working.
它正在工作。

And here, we have to change the verb "to be",
so we say: You were working.
在这里，我们必须改变动词“to be”，
所以我们说：你正在工作。

We were working.
我们正在工作。

They were working.
他们正在工作。

Okay?
好的？

So, it's not only important to remember this
verb +ing, the "working" part, which is not
所以，不仅要记住这个
动词+ing，即“工作”部分，这不是

too difficult, but this part is also very
important.
太难，而且这部分也非常
重要。

Make sure you're using the correct form of
that past tense of the verb "to be" with this
确保你使用
动词“to be”的过去时态和这个时

tense, okay?
态的正确形式，好吗？

Because if you make a mistake here, then you'll
make a mistake in the entire tense, so be
因为如果你在这里犯了错误，那么你就会
在整个时态上犯错误，所以要

careful of that.
小心。

It is here: was, and here it is: were, okay?
它在这里：曾经，这里它：曾经，好吗？

So, let's pay attention to that.
所以，我们要注意这一点。

Next, if it's a negative sentence, it's very
easy, we're just adding "not", okay?
接下来，如果是否定句，就很
简单了，加个“not”就可以了，好吗？

There is a way that we can shorten this and
we will look at that soon, but for now, all
有一种方法可以缩短这个时间，
我们很快就会考虑这个问题，但现在，

we're doing is we're saying this and we're
adding "not".
我们所做的只是说这个，然后
添加“不”。

For example: I was not working.
例如：我没有工作。

He was not working.
他没有工作。

She was not working.
她没有工作。

It was not working.
它不起作用。

Or: You were not working.
或者：你没有工作。

We were not working.
我们没有工作。

They were not working.
他们没有工作。

Okay?
好的？

That's it.
就是这样。

Next, to form a question, we have to change
the order.
接下来，为了形成一个问题，我们必须改变
顺序。

So, instead of saying "I was", we say "Was
I?".
所以，我们不说“我是”，而是说“我是吗
？”。

Instead of "He was", "Was he?", that's it.
不是“他是”，而是“他是吗？”，就是这样。

So, for example, "Was I working yesterday?
例如，“我昨天工作了吗？

I don't remember."
我不记得了。”

Was he working?
他在工作吗？

Was she working when you arrived?
你来的时候她在工作吗？

Was it working the last time you used it?
您上次使用时它有效吗？

Were you working?
你在工作吗？

Were we working?
我们在工作吗？

Were they working?
他们在工作吗？

Okay?
好的？

So, that's the structure of the question.
这就是问题的结构。

Now remember that if you need to add a question
word, you can do that.
现在请记住，如果您需要添加疑问
词，您可以这样做。

What do I mean by a question word?
我所说的疑问词是什么意思？

For example, you could say "Where was he working?",
okay?
例如，你可以说“他在哪里工作？”，
好吗？

So, if you need to add that question word
like, who, what, when, where, why, how often,
因此，如果您需要添加疑问词，
如谁、什么、何时、何地、为什么、

how long, and so on, then you can do that,
just put it here before this, but keep this
多久、多长时间等，那么您可以这样做，
只需将其放在此处之前，但保留此

structure.
结构。

Just put it before the "was", okay?
把它放在“是”之前，好吗？

And then, of course, you will not capitalize
this word "was".
当然，你不会把
“was”这个词大写。

So: Where was he working?
那么：他在哪里工作？

How long was he working?
他工作了多长时间？

And so on, that's it.
诸如此类，仅此而已。

And this is the basic structure of the past
continuous tense.
这就是过去进行时的基本结构
。

Now, let's look at how we use contractions
with the past continuous tense.
现在，让我们看看如何在
过去进行时中使用缩写。

So, contractions are when we shorten or contract
two or three words into one word.
因此，收缩是指我们将
两个或三个单词缩短或收缩为一个单词。

We're going to see how to do that in just
a second.
我们很快就会看到如何做到这
一点。

The important thing for you to remember is
that in this tense, if it's a positive sentence,
你要记住的重要一点
是，在这种时态中，如果它是一个肯定的句子，

we cannot make any contractions, but if it's
negative, we definitely can.
我们不能做任何收缩，但如果它是
否定的，我们绝对可以。

So, let's see how to do that.
那么，让我们看看如何做到这一点。

So, these are the possible negative contractions.
所以，这些都是可能的负面收缩。

If you wanted to say, "I was not", it becomes
"wasn't".
如果你想说“我不是”，它就会变成
“不是”。

I wasn't, alright?
我不是，好吗？

So, what happened here?
那么，这里发生了什么？

How did we get this?
我们是怎么得到这个的？

We basically took these two words, we cancelled
the "o", we added an apostrophe in the place
我们基本上采用了这两个单词，取消了
“o”，在取出字母的地方添加了撇号，然后将这

where we took out the letter and we joined
these two words together.
两个单词连接在一起。

So, "was not" became "wasn't", and "were not",
the other possibility, we do the same thing,
那么，“was not”就变成了“wasn't”，而“were not”，
另一种可能，我们做同样的事情，

we take out the "o", add the apostrophe, and
then "were not" becomes what?
我们把“o”去掉，加上撇号，
然后“were not”就变成了什么？

Weren't.
不是。

Now, there are two things to remember about
these contractions.
现在，关于这些收缩，有两件事需要记住
。

The first is how to spell them.
首先是如何拼写它们。

The second is how to pronounce them.
第二个是如何发音。

So, we're going to practice both in this section
of the lesson.
因此，我们将在本课的这一部分中练习这两个内容
。

So, when would we use which one?
那么，我们什么时候使用哪一个呢？

You've already gone over that a little bit,
so just repeat after me right now and try
你已经复习了一点，
所以现在就跟着我重复一遍，并尝试

to make sure you're pronouncing all of this
word clearly, because if you are trying to
确保你清楚地发音所有这个
词，因为如果你

say "I wasn't watching", but you don't say
the ending "tuh", then it'll sound like "I
想说“我没有在看”，但你 不要说
结尾“tuh”，那么听起来就像“我

was watching", and that's the opposite meaning,
right?
在看”，这是相反的意思，
对吗？

So, repeat after me: I wasn't watching.
所以，跟着我重复一遍：我没有在看。

He wasn't watching.
他没有在看。

She wasn't watching.
她没有在看。

It wasn't watching.
它没有在看。

Now, for the second part, okay?
现在，第二部分，好吗？

A different word, different form of the verb
"to be": You weren't sleeping.
动词“to be”的不同词、不同形式
：你没有睡觉。

Make sure you're saying that "tuh".
确保你说的是“tuh”。

You weren't sleeping.
你没有睡觉。

We weren't sleeping.
我们没有睡觉。

They weren't sleeping.
他们没有睡觉。

Okay?
好的？

And that's basically it in terms of making
the contractions.
这基本上就是
宫缩的过程。

Now, let's look at some of the spelling changes
we need to make in the main verb when using
现在，让我们看看
使用这种时态时需要对主要动词进行的一些拼写更改

this tense.
。

So, for most verbs, all we have to do is to
add -ing.
所以，对于大多数动词，我们所要做的就是
添加-ing。

For example: talk becomes talking.
例如：谈话变成谈话。

Sell - selling.
卖——卖。

With some verbs, you have to do something
a little bit different.
对于某些动词，你必须做
一些不同的事情。

For example, for verbs ending in "e", we have
to drop the "e" and add "-ing".
例如，对于以“e”结尾的动词，我们
必须删除“e”并添加“-ing”。

We're always going to be adding -ing for all
the verbs, but sometimes you have to make
我们总是会为所有动词添加 -ing
，但有时您必须

some changes before that.
在此之前进行一些更改。

For example, for those verbs ending in "e",
like "make" becomes "making", because we're
例如，对于那些以“e”结尾的动词，
像“make”变成“making”，因为我们

dropping the "e", right?
去掉了“e”，对吧？

Take becomes taking without the "e".
Take 变成没有“e”的take。

Next, for verbs ending in "ie", we have to
drop the "ie" and add "y" and then the "-ing".
接下来，对于以“ie”结尾的动词，我们必须
删除“ie”并添加“y”，然后添加“-ing”。

For example: tie becomes tying, alright?
例如：领带变成了领带，好吗？

We added "y" and "-ing".
我们添加了“y”和“-ing”。

Lie, get rid of "ie", add the "y" and
"-ing", lying.
说谎，去掉“ie”，加上“y”和
“-ing”，说谎。

Tie - tying, lie - lying, alright?
打结，撒谎，撒谎，好吗？

And for some verbs that end with a pattern
called C-V-C.
对于一些以
C-V-C 模式结尾的动词。

C-V-C stands for consonant, vowel, consonant.
C-V-C 代表辅音、元音、辅音。

A vowel in English is A, E, I, O, and U, and
a consonant is every other letter.
英语中的元音是 A、E、I、O 和 U，
辅音是每隔一个字母。

So, for some verbs that follow this pattern
that end like this, we have to double the
因此，对于一些遵循这种模式
并以这种方式结尾的动词，我们必须将

last letter.
最后一个字母加倍。

For example, what you need to do is to look
at this word from the end, because not every
例如，你需要做的是
从最后看这个单词，因为不是每个

word will have only three letters, but always
look at the word from the end, okay?
单词都只有三个字母，但总是
从最后看这个单词，好吗？

C-V-C, and if it follows that pattern, then
double the last letter and then add "-ing".
C-V-C，如果遵循该模式，则将
最后一个字母加倍，然后添加“-ing”。

For example: Jog becomes jogging.
例如：慢跑变成慢跑。

What does it mean to jog?
慢跑是什么意思？

To like, run for exercise.
喜欢跑步锻炼身体。

Sit becomes sitting.
坐变成坐。

Alright?
好吧？

So, these are some of the main spelling changes
you need to make in this tense for the verbs.
因此，这些是
您需要对动词的这种时态进行的一些主要拼写更改。

In English, when someone asks you a question,
we don't usually just say "Yes" or "No", because
在英语中，当有人问你问题时，
我们通常不会只说“是”或“否”，因为

it sounds a little bit impolite.
这听起来有点不礼貌。

We can be a little bit more polite than that,
and I'm going to show you how.
我们可以更有礼貌一点，
我将向您展示如何做到。

But also in English, when someone asks you
a question, you don't have to give a very
但在英语中，当有人问你
一个问题时，

long answer if, basically, your information
is "yes" or "no".
如果基本上你的信息
是“是”或“否”，你不必给出很长的答案。

So, I'm going to show you how to give short
answers that allow you to answer in a very
因此，我将向您展示如何给出简短的
答案，以便您能够以非常

polite way and an easy way.
礼貌且简单的方式回答。

So, for example, in this tense, if someone
said "Was he playing video games?", then you
因此，举例来说，在这种时态下，如果有人
说“他在玩电子游戏吗？”，那么你

could just say "Yes, he was.", if it's a positive
answer, or "No, he wasn't.".
可以说“是的，他是。”，如果这是肯定的
答案，或者“不，他不是。”  。

And how do you know that pattern?
你怎么知道这个模式的？

Well, in this case, all we had to do was take
the "was" from the question and use it in
好吧，在这种情况下，我们所要做的就是
从问题中取出“是”并将其用于

our answer, okay?
我们的答案，好吗？

Now, as you can see in the positive answer,
you cannot use any contraction because there
现在，正如您在肯定答案中看到的那样，
您不能使用任何缩写，因为

isn't one, but in the negative one, the negative
answer, yes, do use the contraction, especially
没有缩写，但在否定答案中，否定
答案，是的，确实使用缩写，特别是

in informal conversation where we use these
kind of questions and answers, okay?
在我们使用这些类型的非正式对话中
问题和答案，好吗？

So, just take your answer from the question
itself.
因此，只需从问题本身中获取答案即可
。

Let's take another example.
我们再举一个例子。

"Were they studying for the test?"
“他们是在为考试而学习吗？”

So, you could say again, take your answer
from here: "Yes, they were.", or "No, they
所以，你可以再说一遍，从这里得到你的答案
：“是的，他们是。”，或者“不，他们

weren't.", okay?
不是。”，好吗？

Make sure you you're saying "weren't", "wasn't",
okay?
确保你说的是“不是”，“不是”，
好吗？

Make sure you're saying that ending, otherwise
the meaning changes, alright?
确保你说的是那个结尾，否则
意思就会改变，好吗？

Now, the only one that's different, the only
exception is for questions about you.
现在，唯一不同的是，唯一的
例外是关于您的问题。

So, if someone says, "Were you managing a
team?"
所以，如果有人问：“你在管理一个
团队吗？”

Let's suppose you go for an interview, right?
假设你去面试，对吗？

They're asking you many different kinds of
questions about your previous jobs, and they
他们会问你许多
关于你以前的工作的不同类型的问题，他们会

ask you "Were you managing a team?".
问你“你在管理一个团队吗？”。

So then, of course, you cannot say "were",
your answer will be "Yes, I was.", or "No,
那么，当然，你不能说“是”，
你的答案将是“是的，我是。”，或“不，

I wasn't".
我不是”。

And because you are you and a lot of people
are going to ask you questions about you,
因为你就是你，很多人
会问你有关你的问题，所以

it's good for you to memorize these, okay?
记住这些对你有好处，好吗？

Were you doing this?
你在做这个吗？

Yes, I was.
是的，我是。

No, I wasn't.
不，我不是。

Yes, I was.
是的，我是。

No, I wasn't.
不，我不是。

Okay?
好的？

So, know these answers for yourself but for
anyone else, you can take the answer from
因此，您自己知道这些答案，但对其
他人来说，您可以从问题本身中得到答案

the question itself.
。

So, were you paying attention to this lesson?
那么，你认真听这堂课了吗？

I hope you said "Yes, I was."
我希望你说：“是的，我是。”

Now, let's practice what you've been learning.
现在，让我们练习一下您所学的内容。

So, what we'll do first is we will take some
sentences which, right now, are in the present
因此，我们首先要做的就是选取一些
现在

continuous, and we're going to change them
to the past continuous.
进行时的句子，然后将它们更改
为过去进行时。

For example: I am learning.
例如：我正在学习。 我们一直在学习的

How would you say that in the past continuous,
which we've been learning?
过去进行时你怎么说
？

What would it become?
它会变成什么？

"I am" becomes "I was learning.", okay?
“我是”变成“我正在学习”，好吗？

I was learning.
我正在学习。

We are waiting.
我们正在等待。

What does that become?
那会变成什么？

We were waiting, okay?
我们一直在等待，好吗？

Very good.
非常好。

He is singing, in the present, becomes what
in the past?
他在唱歌，现在的过去，变成了什么
？

In the past continuous, we say "He was singing.",
okay?
在过去进行时，我们说“他在唱歌。”，
好吗？

Very good.
非常好。

Now, for these, these are already in the past
continuous, but we're going to - right now,
现在，对于这些，这些已经是过去
进行时了，但我们现在要——现在，

they're positive sentences.
它们是肯定句子。

We're going to change them into negative sentences.
我们要把它们改成否定句。

So, let's start with the first one: Ruby was
teaching.
那么，让我们从第一个开始：Ruby 正在
教学。

How would we make it negative?
我们如何将其变为负值？

It would be "was", what's the key word?
应该是“was”，关键词是什么？

"not" teaching, okay?
“不”教学，好吗？

Ruby was not teaching.
鲁比没有在教书。

Number five: Simon was winning.
第五：西蒙赢了。

Make it negative and this time, we'll try
to make a contraction.
使其为负值，这一次，我们将尝试
进行收缩。

Simon - yes - wasn't winning.
西蒙——是的——没有获胜。

Okay?
好的？

Simon wasn't winning.
西蒙没有获胜。

We were driving.
我们当时正在开车。

Make it negative and a contraction.
使其为负值并收缩。

We weren't, okay, pay attention to the spelling
also, we weren't driving, okay.
我们没有，好吧，也要注意拼写
，我们没有开车，好吧。

Great.
伟大的。

Let's look at number seven.
我们来看看第七个。

Now, we're going to make a question.
现在，我们要提出一个问题。

Right now, it's a sentence: Steven was going
to the conference.
现在，这是一句话：史蒂文要去
参加会议。

So, I want you to help me make a question
starting with the question word "where".
所以，我想让你帮我提出一个
以疑问词“where”开头的问题。

Steven was going to 
the conference.
史蒂文要去参加
会议。

Where was Steven going?
史蒂文要去哪里？

Okay?
好的？

Very good.
非常好。

And number eight, same thing: She was doing
her homework.
第八，同样的事情：她正在
做作业。

What does that become?
那会变成什么？

Let's start the question with the word "what".
让我们从“什么”这个词开始这个问题。

What was she doing?
她在做什么？

Right?
正确的？

Because what are we doing with the questions?
因为我们用这些问题来做什么？

We're changing that order.
我们正在改变这个顺序。

She was - was she?
她是——是吗？

Steven was - was Steven?
史蒂文是——是史蒂文吗？

Okay?
好的？

So, you've done a lot of practice, very good!
所以，你已经做了很多练习，非常好！

Now, let's look at some common mistakes that
are made with this tense, and you can help
现在，让我们看看
这个时态的一些常见错误，你可以帮助

me correct them.
我纠正它们。

So, sometimes the wrong tense is used.
因此，有时会使用错误的时态。

For example, this student wrote "I am studying
when you called."
例如，这位学生写道“
你打电话时我正在学习”。

So, what should it be?
那么，应该是什么呢？

"I am studying" is the present continuous,
but that's not what we need, we need the past
“我正在学习”是现在进行时，
但这不是我们需要的，我们需要过去

continuous, so this one should be "I was".
进行时，所以这应该是“我是”。

I 
was studying, right?
我
正在学习，对吗？

I was studying when you called.
你打电话的时候我正在学习。

Alright.
好吧。

Sometimes, the mistake is with the verb "to
be".
有时，错误在于动词“to
be”。

For example, this person wrote "We was relaxing."
例如，这个人写道“我们很放松”。

They got this part right, but is this right?
这部分他们是对的，但是这是对的吗？

No.
不，

What's the correct form?
正确的形式是什么？

We should say "We were relaxing.", okay?
我们应该说“我们正在放松。”，好吗？

Good.
好的。

Sometimes, there are spelling mistakes.
有时，会出现拼写错误。

For example: "She was bakeing a cake."
例如：“她正在烤蛋糕。”

Do remember what we do when we have a verb
which is like this: bake, it ends with an
请记住，当我们有一个像这样的动词时我们会做什么
：bake，它以

"e", so we need to cancel the "e" before we
add "-ing".
“e”结尾，所以我们需要在
添加“-ing”之前取消“e”。

Good.
好的。

Sometimes, there's a problem with the word
order.
有时，词序会出现问题
。

You might have all the right words, but not
in the right order.
您可能拥有所有正确的词语，但
顺序不正确。

For example: "When you were going to call?"
例如：“你打算什么时候打电话？”

that's not right.
这是不对的。

What should it be?
应该是什么？

"When were you going to call?", okay?
“你打算什么时候打电话？”，可以吗？

Sometimes, words are missing.
有时，言语会缺失。

For example: "You waiting a long time?"
例如：“你等很久了吗？”

What should it be?
应该是什么？

This is a question, so which word goes first?
这是一个问题，那么哪个词在前呢？

Goes here, it should be "Were you".
走到这里，应该是“你是吗”。

"Were you waiting a long time?", not just
"you waiting".
“你等很久了吗？”，而不仅仅是
“你在等”。

Were you waiting a long time?
你等了很久吗？

Okay?
好的？

Good.
好的。

Let's look at another example where there
are missing words.
让我们看另一个
缺少单词的例子。

"He talking to a client."
“他正在和一位客户谈话。”

Let's suppose this is in the past continuous.
假设这是过去进行时。

What's missing?
缺少什么？

Again, the verb "to be", that helping verb,
we need that, so it should be "He was talking
再说一次，动词“to be”，那个帮助动词，
我们需要它，所以它应该是“他正在

to a client.", okay?
和客户说话。”，好吗？

Now it's correct and of course, we have to
remember that, with this tense, we can't use
现在它是正确的，当然，我们必须
记住，在这种时态下，我们不能使用

many of the stative verbs.
许多静态动词。

So, this student made a mistake and said,
"I was believing you.", but "believe" is one
所以，这个学生犯了一个错误，他说：
“我相信你。”，但“相信”是

of those stative verbs, so we just cannot
use it in this tense.
静态动词之一，所以我们不能
在这种时态中使用它。

So, we would have had to say, "I believed
you.", which is just past simple.
所以，我们不得不说，“我相信
你。”，这简直太简单了。

We cannot use this word with the continuous
form.
我们不能使用这个词的连续
形式。

So, these are some of the main mistakes you
should be careful of.
因此，这些是您
应该小心的一些主要错误。

So, congratulations!
那么，恭喜你！

例如，您知道您会说“罗伯特

or "Was Robert driving?", okay?
或“罗伯特在开车吗？”，好吗？

And when you can do that, it means that you
can move comfortably between different kinds
当你能做到这一点时，就意味着你
可以在不同类型

of sentences and different kinds of usages
of this tense, alright?
的句子和
这种时态的不同用法之间轻松切换，好吗？
