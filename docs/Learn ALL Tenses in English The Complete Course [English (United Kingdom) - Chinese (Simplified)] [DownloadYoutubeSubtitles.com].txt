Okay, firstly, we're going to 
talk about the perfect tenses,  
好的，首先，我们要

from the present perfect simple 
to the future perfect continuous.
从现在完成简单到
将来完成进行时。

Are you ready?
你准备好了吗？

Today's lesson is truly perfect. We're going to 
cover the perfect tenses. As I have heard you loud  
今天的课程真是完美。我们将介绍

and clear, these are the tenses that you struggle 
most with. Don't worry, it's not your fault! I  
很明显，这些是您最难以应对的时态

often feel frustrated when I see lessons on the 
perfect tenses or explanations in grammar books.
当我看到关于完成时态的课程或语法书
中的解释时，常常感到沮丧。

I don't feel like they're clear enough. In 
this video, I'm going to teach you how to  
我感觉他们说的还不够清楚。在

use the perfect tenses, and you will probably 
find that the way I explain them is different  
使用完成时态，你可能会发现

from how you've been taught before. I promise 
you that when you're done with this lesson,  
从你之前被教导的方式来看。我向

you're going to feel much more confident 
about how to use the past, present,  
你会对如何使用过去

and future perfect simple tenses in 3 key ways.
以及未来完成时态的 3 个主要方面。

Okay, back to the perfect tenses. Or 
should I say the perfect aspect. I  
好吧，回到完成时态。或者我

don't normally talk about tense versus 
aspect in my videos, but I think it's  
我的视频中通常不会谈论时态

important and useful to mention it today. 
We only have 2 tenses in English—present:
今天提及这一点很重要也很有用。
英语中只有两种时态——现在时：

'I go, she goes' and—past: 'I went, she went'. 
Aspects add information about the way we view a  
“我走了，她走了”，然后——过去：“我走了，她走

verb. For example, an aspect can show whether 
an action is complete or continuing. When we  
动词。例如，一个方面可以显示某个操作

use the perfect aspect, we look back from 
a certain point in time to another point  
使用完美的方面，我们从某个时间

in time. I'm going to explain lots more about 
this, and I will give you lots of examples.
及时。我将对此进行更多解释
，并向您提供大量示例。

I am going to refer to them as 
the perfect tenses from now on,  
从现在开始我将把它们

because I think that's the name most of 
you are familiar with. We don't have to  
因为我认为这是你们大多数人

overcomplicate this. So let's talk about 
how we form the perfect tenses. The present  
使这变得过于复杂。那么我们来

perfect simple and the past perfect simple 
have very similar forms. We form positive  
简单完成时和简单过去完成时的形式

sentences in the present perfect simple with 
subject + 'have' or 'has' + past participle.
现在完成时的句子，主语+“have”
或“has”+过去分词。

And we form the past perfect simple with 
subject + 'had' + past participle. 'I have  
我们用主语 + 'had' + 过去分词

been to London.' 'I had been to London.' To form 
negative sentences, we add 'not' after 'have',  
去过伦敦。 “我去过伦敦。”要构成否定

'has' or 'had'. For example—'She has not been to 
London,' 'She had not been to London'. And to form  
‘有’或‘有’。例如，“她没有去过伦敦

questions, we invert the subject and 'have', 
'has', or 'had'. 'Had she been to London.'
问题时，我们会颠倒主语并使用“have”、“has”
或“had”。 “她去过伦敦吗？”

We form positive sentences in the future 
perfect simple with subject + 'will have' + past  
我们用主语 + “will have” +
过去时构成未来完成时的肯定句

participle. 'I will have been to London.' To 
form negative sentences, we add 'not' after  
分词。 “我会去伦敦。”要构成否定

'will'. 'I will not have been to London.' And to 
form questions, we invert the subject and 'will'.  
'将要'。 “我不会去伦敦。”为了形成

'Will they have been to London?' In speech and 
in formal writing we often use contractions.  
“他们会去伦敦吗？”在演讲和正式

'Have' is often contracted to—'ve—apostrophe 've', 
and 'has' is often contracted to apostrophe 's',  
“Have”通常缩写为“ve”，撇号“ve”，

pronounced /s/ or /z/ depending on whether 
an unvoiced or voiced sound comes before it.
发音为 /s/ 或 /z/ 取决于其
前面是清音还是浊音。

For example—'I've been to London', 'He's 
been to London', 'Pat's been to London'.  
例如，“我去过伦敦”、“他去过

In negative sentences, we usually 
contract 'have not' to 'haven't',  
在否定句中，我们通常将“have
not”缩写为“haven't”，

and 'has not' to 'hasn't'. 'You haven't been to 
London?' 'She hasn't been to London.' 'Had' is  
以及“没有”到“没有”。 “你没去过伦敦

often contracted to apostrophe 'd'. 'He'd 
been to London.' In negative sentences,  
经常缩写为撇号“d”。 “他去

'had not' is often contracted to 
'hadn't'. 'We hadn't been to London.'
“had not”通常缩写为“hadn't”。
“我们没去过伦敦。”

'Will' is often contracted to apostrophe 
'll'. 'They'll have been to London.' Notice  
“Will”通常缩写为撇号“ll”。

that I pronounce 'have' as /əv/ when I'm 
speaking quickly. 'They'll have been to  
当我说话很快时，我将“have”

London.' And 'will not' is usually contracted 
to 'won't'. 'I won't have been to London.' Okay,  
伦敦。' “will not”通常缩写为“won't”。

now all of that's out of the way, let's talk 
about the uses of the perfect tenses. In very  
现在所有这些都已经解决了，让我们

general terms, we use the present perfect 
simple to look back from the present time.
一般而言，我们使用现在完成
时简单地回顾现在。

We use the past perfect simple to look 
back from a point in the past. And we  
我们使用过去完成时来回顾过去

use the future perfect simple to look 
back from a point in the future. It  
使用简单将来完成时从未来的

all makes sense. Let's talk about the 3 
key uses. First—life experiences. We use  
一切都有道理。让我们来谈谈 3 个关键

the perfect simple tenses to talk about life 
experiences up to a specific point in time.
用于谈论特定时间点之前的生活
经历的完美简单时态。

We don't say exactly when these life experiences 
happened. When we use a perfect tense,  
我们没有确切地说这些生活经历发生的时间

we use the present perfect simple to talk about 
life experiences up to now. The experiences  
我们用现在完成时来谈论迄今

happened in the past, but we are looking at 
them from the present. For example—'I have  
发生在过去，但我们是从现在来

been to New York.' That means at some point 
in my life up to now, I went to New York.
去过纽约。这意味着到目前为止，在我
生命中的某个时刻，我去了纽约。

You don't know when exactly, you know 
it was before the present time and this  
你不知道确切的时间，你知道那

event is completed. I am no longer in New York.
活动已完成。我已经不在纽约了。

We can use the past perfect simple to talk about  
我们可以用简单的过去完成时来谈论  

life experiences that happened 
before a point in the past.
过去某个时刻之前发生
的生活经历。

For example—'I had been to New York by 
the time I was 25.' In this example,  
例如，“我 25 岁时就去过纽约

the point from which we are looking 
back is age 25, and the sentence tells  
我们回顾的起点是 25 岁

you that before I was 25, I went to New 
York. We use the future perfect simple  
你知道，在我 25 岁之前，我去了

to talk about life experiences that will be 
complete by a specific point in the future.
谈论将在未来某个特定时刻
完成的生活经历。

Here's that same example again—'I will have 
been to New York by the time I'm 35.' Age 35  
又是同样的例子——“我 35 岁时

for me is in the future. This sentence tells us 
that before I am 35, I will visit New York. You  
对我来说是未来。这句话告诉我们，

don't know when, but the action of visiting 
New York will happen before I'm 35. Okay,  
不知道什么时候，但去纽约的举动会
在我 35 岁之前发生。好吧，

the next use I want to talk about is 
four unfinished states and actions.
我想谈的下一个用途是四个
未完成的状态和动作。

We can use the perfect tenses to talk 
about states and actions that begin  
我们可以使用完成时态来谈论

before a point in time and continue up to 
that point. This usage often tells us the  
在某个时间点之前并继续到该时间

duration of the action up to a certain 
point. We can sometimes use the perfect  
操作到某一点的持续时间。

simple or perfect continuous tenses when 
talking about how long something lasts.
当谈论某事持续多长时间时，
使用简单或完成进行时。

We use the present perfect simple to talk 
about states or actions that began in the  
我们使用现在完成

past and continue to the present. We don't 
know if they will continue in the future.  
过去并延续到现在。我们不知道

Here is an example—'I have lived in Manchester for  
举个例子——“我已经在曼彻斯特住了

5 years.' I started living in Manchester 
5 years ago and I still live there now.
5年。我五年前开始住在曼彻斯特
，现在仍然住在那里。

We use the past perfect simple to talk about 
states or actions that began in the past and  
我们使用过去完成时来谈论

continued up to a later point in the 
past. 'I had lived in Manchester for  
一直持续到过去的某个时刻。 “

5 years by the time I was 23.' This means that 
I started living in Manchester when I was 18,  
到我 23 岁时，已经过去了 5 年。”这意味

and I still lived there when 
I was 23, 5 years later.
5年后，我23岁时仍然
住在那里。

You don't know if I continued living there after 
that. That's not clear in this sentence. We use  
你不知道那之后我是否继续住在那里
。这句话的意思不清楚。我们使用

the future perfect simple to talk about 
states and actions that will continue to  
将来完成时简单地谈论

a point in the future. 'I will have lived in 
Manchester for 5 years by the time I'm 33.'  
未来的某个点。 “到 33 岁时，我

In this sentence, the starting point 
for living in Manchester is age 28,  
在这句话中，居住在曼彻斯特

which is in the past. Five years later I 
will be 33 and still living in Manchester.
这是过去的事了。五年后，我 33
岁了，仍然住在曼彻斯特。

Okay, time for the final use. I'm calling this 
use consequences. Consequences! We can use the  
好了，到了最后的使用时间了。我称之

perfect simple tenses to talk about things that 
happened before a point in time but are relevant  
完美简单时态，用于谈论某个时间点

at that point. It's like talking about the 
consequences of an action or event. We use the  
在那一点上。这就像谈论某个行动

present perfect simple to talk about an event 
that happened in the past but is important in  
现在完成时简单地谈论过去

the present. For example—'I've been out every 
night this week, so I'm really tired today.'
现在。例如，“这周我每天晚上都出去
，所以今天我真的很累。”

That's a past action with a present consequence. I 
was out every night up to now and I am tired now.  
这是过去的行为造成现在的结果。到目前

We use the past perfect simple to talk about an 
event that happened in the past that was important  
我们使用过去完成时来谈论

at a later date in the past. For example—'I'd been 
out every night that week, so I was really tired.'
在过去的晚些时候。例如，“那周我每天
晚上都出去，所以我真的很累。”

A past action with a past consequence. I 
went out every night of a week in the past,  
过去的行为产生过去的后果。

and the next day I was tired. Both 
of those events are in the past.  
第二天我很累。这两件

And the future perfect simple. We use 
the future perfect simple to talk about  
将来完成时简单。我们用

something that will happen before a point in the 
future that will be relevant at a later time.
未来某个时间点之前将发生
且稍后相关的事情。

For example—'I will have been out every night that 
week, so I will be really tired.' It's a future  
例如——“那一周我每天晚上都会出去
，所以我会非常累。”这是一个未来

action with a likely future consequence. I will 
go out every night for a week in the future and  
具有未来可能后果的行动。

then I will be tired. Okay, that is everything 
I want to say about the perfect tenses today.
那我会累的。好的，这就是我今天要
说的关于完成时态的全部内容。

Okay, that was a perfect lesson right? Now, 
you've already heard a lot of information,  
好吧，这是一个完美的教训，对吗？

so I definitely think you need my 
tenses ebook to help you remember it.
所以我绝对认为您需要我的时态
电子书来帮助您记住它。

you also get my B1 to C1 ebook.
当然，当您获得该书时，您还会

Okay, are you ready for the next tenses? We are  
好吧，你准备好迎接下一个时态了吗？我们是  

going to dive into the present 
perfect simple and continuous.
将深入研究现在完成时、
简单且连续的情况。

Today, I have got a grammar lesson for you. We 
are going to be looking at two very similar and  
今天，我为你们上了一堂语法课
。我们将研究两个非常相似的

confusing tenses. I know that a lot of my students 
struggle with these. Take a look at these two  
令人困惑的时态。我知道我的很多学生都在

sentences: 'I have lived in England for 3 years.' 
'I have been living in England for 3 years.'
句子：“我在英国生活了 3 年。”  “
我已经在英国生活了三年了。”

Do they mean the same thing? Today, we are looking  
它们的意思是一样的吗？今天，我们正在寻找  

at the present perfect and the present 
perfect continuous. In some situations,  
现在完成时和现在完成进行

they mean the same thing, and in other 
situations, they mean different things.
它们的含义相同，但在其他情况
下，它们的含义不同。

We use the present perfect and the present 
perfect continuous for both finished and  
我们使用现在完成时和现在完成进行

unfinished actions. Let's take a quick look at 
how we form them before we start comparing them.
未完成的动作。在开始比较它们之前，让
我们快速浏览一下它们是如何形成的。

So, the present perfect is 'have/has' + the past 
participle. 'I have worked.' The negative—'have'  
所以，现在完成时是“have/has”+过去分词

and 'has' + 'not' + the past participle. 
'I have not worked.' And, as a question,  
'has' + 'not' + 过去分词。  “我没有

'have or has' + the subject + the past participle. 
'Have I worked?' Now, let's take a look at how  
‘have or has’+主语+过去分词。  “我工作

we form the present perfect continuous. The 
positive is 'have' or 'has' + 'been' + verb -ing.
我们形成现在完成进行时。肯定的形式
是“have”或“has”+“been”+动词-ing。

'I have been working.' The negative—we just 
put in a 'not'. 'Has' or 'have', 'not', 'been',  
“我一直在工作。”消极的一面——我们只是加上了一

verb -ing. 'I have not been working.' And as 
a question, we have—'has' or 'have' + subject  
动词-ing. “我没有工作。”作为一个问题

+ 'been' + a verb -ing. 'Have I been working?' 
It's important to note that we cannot use the  
+ 'been' + 动词 -ing。 “我一直在工作吗？”

present perfect continuous with stative verbs. 
Stative verbs don't refer to a physical action.
现在完成进行时与静态动词一起使用
。  静态动词不指身体动作。

They express something that is permanent. They 
express a state or a condition. 'To like.'  
它们表达的是永恒的东西。它们表达

'To love.' 'To believe.' 'To know.' 'To 
understand.' You can say—'I've known her  
“去爱。” “相信。” “要知道。” “

for years.' You cannot say—'I've been knowing 
her for years.' You can say—'I've been here for  
多年来。你不能说——“我认识她很多年了

a while.' You cannot say—'I've been being 
here for a while.' Just so that's clear.
一会儿。你不能说——“我在这里已经
有一段时间了。”这样就清楚了。

We can use the present perfect and the present 
perfect continuous to talk about actions,  
我们可以使用现在完成时和现在

unfinished actions that started in 
the past and are still true now.  
从过去开始但现在仍然存在

We often use them with 'since' and 'for'. 'I 
have lived in England for 3 years.' 'I have been  
我们经常将它们与“since”和“for”一起使用

studying English since 2003.' 'I've been studying 
English since 2017.' Now, sometimes, especially  
自 2003 年起学习英语。” “我自 2017 年以来

with the verbs 'study', 'live' and 'work', there 
is no real difference in meaning between the two.
对于动词“学习”、“生活”和“工作”，
两者之间的含义没有真正的区别。

'I've lived in England for 3 years.' 'I've been 
living in England for 3 years.' They mean the  
“我在英国住了三年了。” “我在英国

same thing. 'I've studied English since 2017.' 
'I've been studying English since 2017.' Again,  
同样的事情。 “我从 2017 年开始学习英语。”

they mean the same thing. 'She has worked here 
for 6 months.' 'She has been working here for 6  
它们的意思是一样的。 “她在这里工作
了六个月。” “她在这里工作了 6 年

months.' Once again, they mean the same thing. 
So, I hope that clears up some of your doubts.
个月。”再一次，它们的意思是一样的。因此
，我希望这可以消除您的一些疑虑。

Unfortunately, sometimes there is a difference 
in meaning between these 2 tenses, the present  
不幸的是，有时这两种时态之间

perfect and the present perfect continuous. 
I'm going to discuss 4 situations where there  
完成时和现在完成进行时

is a difference in meaning. Number 1—the 
present perfect continuous can be used to  
是意义的区别。数字 1——

emphasise the amount or length of time that has 
passed, whereas the present perfect is generally  
强调已经过去的时间量或长度

neutral. It might sound complicated, 
but take a look at these 2 sentences.
中性的。听起来可能很复杂
，但请看一下这两句话。

'She's been working for hours!' 'She has 
worked for hours.' 'She's been working!'  
“她已经工作了好几个小时了！” “她已经工作

Shows more emphasis about the hours that 
have passed. It's a very subtle difference,  
更加强调已经过去的时间。

but it's there. The second situation, 
the present perfect is commonly used to  
但它就在那里。第二种情况

talk about how much or how many, but 
this is impossible with the present  
谈论多少或多少，但这对于

perfect continuous. Let me show you: 'She has 
eaten three pieces of toast this morning.'
完美连续。让我告诉你：“她今天
早上吃了三片吐司。”

That sentence is perfectly fine. Let's try 
it with the present perfect continuous. 'She  
这句话非常好。我们来尝试

has been eating 3 pieces of toast this 
morning.' It doesn't work. You can't  
今天早上吃了 3 片吐司。”

use it. 'He's drunk 7 cups of coffee 
this morning,'—I hope not, poor guy.  
使用它。 “他今天早上喝了七杯咖啡

You cannot say—'He has been drinking 7 cups of 
coffee this morning.' It has to be the present
你不能说——“他今天早上已经喝
了 7 杯咖啡。”必须是现在

perfect when talking about how much or how 
many. Let's take a look at the third situation.  
当谈论多少或多少时是完美的

The present perfect continuous often focuses on 
the action itself, whereas the present perfect  
现在完成进行时通常关注动作

focus is on the completion of the action. Again, 
it's much easier to see this written out than  
焦点在于动作的完成。再说一
遍，写出来比看要容易得多

to listen to an explanation. So, I'll give you 
some examples. Take a look at these 2 sentences:
听取解释。那么，我给你举一些
例子。看一下这两句话：

'I've been watching the TV series you 
recommended.' 'I've watched the TV  
“我一直在看你推荐的电视剧

series you recommended.' With the first one—'I've  
你推荐的系列。第一个——“我已经  

been watching'—I'm showing that I am still 
watching it. I haven't finished the action yet,  
一直在看’——我表明我仍
在看它。我还没有完成动作，

whereas with the second one—'I've watched,' 
I'm telling you that I have finished  
而第二个——“我已经看过了”，

watching it. Sometimes, it's not quite as 
obvious. 'She's been seeing a therapist.'
看着它。有时，它并不那么明显
。 “她一直在看治疗师。”

'She's seen a therapist.' With—'She's been 
seeing'—it implies that her treatment is ongoing;  
“她去看过心理医生了。” “她一直
在看病”意味着她的治疗仍在进行中；

she's still seeing that therapist. 'She's 
seen a therapist' means she's seen one,  
她还在看那个治疗师。 “她看过一位治疗师

and now she may have stopped seeing one,  
现在她可能已经不再见到一个人了，  

or her treatment has ended. Another thing 
to note is that, with the present perfect,  
或者她的治疗已经结束。另一件需要

we can use 'yet' and 'already'. I know lots 
of you struggle with 'for', 'since' 'yet',
我们可以使用“还”和“已经”。我知道你们很多人都在
为“因为”、“因为”、“但是”等词而苦苦挣扎

and 'already'. We've discussed 'for' for 
instance—now, 'yet' and 'already'. 'I have  
和“已经”。例如，我们已经讨论过“为了

seen the film already', or 'I've already seen 
the film'. You can put 'already' at the end,  
已经看过这部电影了”或“我已经看过这部

or you can put it between 'have' or 'has' 
and the participle. 'I have already seen.'  
或者您可以将其放在“have”或“has”

A common mistake that I hear is—'I have 
seen already the film.' That doesn't quite,  
我听到的一个常见错误是——“我已经

we would understand you, but 
it doesn't quite sound right.
我们会理解你的意思，
但听起来不太对劲。

And 'yet', this goes at the end. 'Have you 
seen the film yet?' 'No, I haven't seen it  
然而，这一切都到了最后。 “你看过

yet.' You can put 'yet' between 'have', 'has' 
and the participle: 'I haven't yet seen it',  
然而。'您可以在“have”、“has”和分词之间

but it sounds quite old-fashioned. 'I 
haven't yet gone.' 'I haven't yet seen  
但这听起来相当老套。 “我
还没有去。” “我还没看到

it.' It sounds nice; it sounds very formal and 
old-fashioned. Like you'd read in an old book.
它。'听起来不错；这听起来非常正式和老式
。就像你在一本旧书中读到的那样。

In the question form, it doesn't sound right at 
all. 'Have you yet seen the film?' No, don't use  
从问题形式来看，这听起来根本不对。 “

that. Sometimes we use the difference between the 
present perfect and the present perfect continuous  
那。有时我们会使用现在完成时

to talk about different kinds of results in the 
present. Again, it's much easier to see this in  
谈论当前的不同类型的结果。同样

an example, so I will provide those. 'I've done 
all of my chores, so I can come out tonight.'
一个例子，所以我将提供这些。 “我已经做完了
所有的家务，所以今晚我可以出来了。”

We use the present perfect when the result comes 
from the action being finished. I can come out  
当结果来自正在完成的动作时，我们

tonight because I've finished my chores; 
it's completed. 'I've been doing my chores,  
今晚因为我已经完成了我的家务活；

so I'm exhausted.' We use the present perfect 
continuous when the result comes from doing the  
所以我累坏了。当结果来自于执行以下

action itself. I am exhausted from carrying 
out all of my chores. Another example—'I've  
行动本身。我因完成所有家务而精疲力

prepared a big dinner, so you can come over.'
准备了一顿丰盛的晚餐，你就过来吧。”

'I've been preparing a big dinner, so all 
of my pans are dirty.' My pans are dirty  
“我一直在准备一顿丰盛的晚餐，所以

as a result of the preparation, but you can 
come over because I've finished preparing  
作为准备的结果，但你可以过来

the dinner. In the first example, with the 
present perfect, you can come over because  
晚餐。在第一个示例中，使用现在

I've finished preparing my dinner. In the second 
example, with the present perfect continuous,  
我已经准备好晚餐了。在第二个例子
中，使用现在完成进行时，

all of my pans are dirty because of 
the preparation of my dinner—the action 
我所有的锅子都脏了
，因为要准备晚餐——

of doing it. Finally, we can use the present 
perfect continuous to talk about situations that  
这样做。最后，我们可以使用现在

aren't permanent, things that are not usual. 
'I've been sleeping badly.' I don't normally  
不是永久的，不是平常的事情。  “

sleep badly, but recently I've been sleeping 
badly. 'Normally, I buy lunch at the canteen,  
睡眠不好，但最近我一直睡不好。

but I've been bringing lunch from home.' 
'I've been getting up early to work out.'
但我一直从家里带午餐。  “
我一直很早就起床锻炼。”

I don't usually do this, but 
recently I have been doing this.
我通常不这样做，但最近
我一直在这样做。

So now, you've learned the 
differences between those

tenses. I want to test your knowledge with a quiz.
時态。我想通过测验来测试一下你的知识。

To do that. Download the 
giant ebook I've made for you.
这样做。下载我为您

I've built quizzes into it.
我已经在其中加入了测验。

Now, I think it's time to look 
to the future. Or is it? The next  
现在，我认为是时候展望未来

lesson explains how to talk about the future 
and whether we need to use future tenses.
本课解释了如何谈论将来以及我们
是否需要使用将来时态。

You're probably a bit shocked by the title 
and the thumbnail. Do you mean there's no  
您可能会对标题和缩略图感到有点

future tense? Why should I stop using it? I'm 
going to talk about the future tense. Are you  
一般将来时？我为什么要停止使用

intrigued? Well, just saying, the future 
tense is considered incorrect. Why? Well,  
好奇吗？嗯，只是说，将来时态被认为

because there's no such thing as the 
future tense in English. I know—mind-blown.
因为英语中没有将来时这样
的东西。我知道——令人震惊。

If you look in most grammar books, you'll 
likely see a section named something like  
如果您查看大多数语法书，您可能

'talking about the future' and 
not 'future tenses'. In fact,  
“谈论未来”而不是“将来

there are only 2 tenses in English—the present and 
the past. These tenses are then further divided  
英语只有两种时态——现在时和过去

into aspects like continuous and perfect. We 
tend to call each tense + aspect = a tense.
比如连续和完美等方面。我们倾向于
将每个时态+体称为一个时态。

For example, the present perfect tense or the 
past continuous tense. It's just simpler to  
例如，现在完成时或过去

think about them like this, and it's probably what 
you've been taught at school and all through your  
像这样思考它们，这可能就是你在

English learning journey. Anyway, back to the 
future. A key feature in English tenses is verb  
英语学习之旅。无论如何，回到未来

inflection. In the present tense, for instance, 
we add 's' to third person singular verbs,  
词形变化。例如，在现在时中，我们在

and in the past tense, regular verbs often get an 
-ed suffix. For example—'like', 'likes', 'liked'.
在过去时态中，规则动词通常带有 -ed 后缀。
例如，“喜欢”、“喜欢”、“喜欢”。

However, the future differs from the present 
in past tenses in a significant way. We don't  
然而，未来时态与现在时态

have a specific verb inflection to indicate 
it, so there's no future tense technically.  
有特定的动词变形来表示它，因此

But I think it's so much easier to think 
about the future as a tense in the same  
但我认为用同样的时态来

way as you think of the present and 
past tenses. So I'm taking a stand.
就像你思考现在时和过去时一样
。所以我要表明立场。

This video is about the future tenses, and I'm 
going to explain how you can use them in English.
该视频是关于将来时的，我将向
您解释如何用英语使用它们。

Right, let's start with Will. 'Will' is a 
very handsome man and is also a modal verb  
好吧，让我们从威尔开始吧。 “Will”是一

that can be used to talk about the future. 
We use it in what we call the future simple,  
可以用来谈论未来。  我们

future continuous, future perfect simple 
and the future perfect continuous.
将来进行时、简单将来完成时
和将来完成进行时。

The future simple—we have 'will' + base 
verb. We use the future simple to make  
简单将来时——我们有“will”+基本

predictions. We also use it to talk about 
decisions made at the moment of speaking,  
预测。我们还用它来谈论

and we use it to make offers and promises. 'It 
will be a wonderful party. I just know it.'  
我们用它来提出报价和承诺。 “这将是

'The dog's getting a bit boisterous. I'll walk 
him.' The contraction there—'I will', 'I'll'.
“狗有点吵闹了。我会遛他。那里的
缩写——“我会”，“我会”。

And—'I'll get you another size to try 
on.' Okay, let's move to the future  
而且——“我会给你换一个尺码来试穿

continuous. This is 'will' + 'be' + -ing 
verb. We use the future continuous to talk  
连续的。这是“will”+“be”+-ing 动词

about temporary actions and events that 
will be in progress at a time later than  
关于将在稍后时间进行

now. For example—'This time tomorrow, we will be 
sitting down to dinner at my dream restaurant',  
现在。例如，“明天这个时候，我们将

or—'I'll be walking to work tomorrow, 
as my car is at the mechanic's'.
或者——“我明天步行去上班，因为
我的车在修理厂”。

The future perfect simple—'will' + have 
+ the past participle. We use the future  
简单将来完成时——“will”+have+

perfect simple to talk about events that 
will be finished at a certain time later  
完美简单地谈论将在稍后

than now. It's like we walk into the 
future and then turn around and look  
比现在。这就像我们走进

back. I don't normally show you the back of 
my head. Do you want to know how I do this
后退。我通常不会向你展示我的后脑勺
。你想知道我是怎么做到的吗

amazing knot. Maybe I'll show you one day, 
I have to do a lesson on hair. By the way,  
惊人的结。也许有一天我会告诉你，我必须

we don't typically call this a 'knot'. We call 
this a 'bun'. A 'knot' is not something you want  
我们通常不称其为“结”。我们称之为“

to know. Some examples—'We will definitely have 
arrived by 7 pm,' or 'They'll have already eaten  
知道。一些例子——“我们肯定会在晚上 7 点

before they come round, so 
we don't need to feed them'.
在它们出生之前，我们
不需要喂它们”。

And the future perfect continuous—'will' + 'have 
been' + -ing verb. We use the future perfect  
以及未来完成进行时——“will”+“have be”+-ing

continuous to emphasise the duration of an event 
that will be happening at a time later than now.  
持续强调将在比现在晚的时间

It's similar to the future perfect simple in that 
we look back from a time in the future. Again,  
它类似于将来完成时，我们从未来

another opportunity to show my bun. For 
example—'In 6 months' time, we will have been  
另一个展示我的发髻的机会。

working here for 7 years,' or 'By this time next 
week, I will have been travelling for 4 months.
在这里工作了 7 年”或“到下周这个
时候，我已经出差 4 个月了”。

A quick note about the future perfect 
simple and continuous here. With some verbs,  
这里简要介绍一下将来完成时
、简单进行时。对于一些动词，

you can use either tense with no change 
in meaning. One of those verbs is 'work'.  
您可以使用任一时态，而含义不

Take a look! 'In 6 months' time, we will have 
worked here for 7 years.' 'In 6 months' time,  
看看吧！ “6 个月后，我们将在这里

we will have been working here for 7 years.' They 
mean pretty much the same thing in the future
我们将在这里工作 7 年。它们
在未来的含义几乎相同

perfect continuous. There is more of a feeling 
of emphasis on just how long you've worked there,  
完美连续。更多的是一种强调你

but you really can use either. Other verbs like 
this include 'live', 'play', and 'teach'. However,  
但你确实可以使用其中任何一个。其他类似的

with lots of verbs like 'read', you can't use them 
interchangeably. For example—'By tomorrow night,  
对于很多像“读”这样的动词，你不能互

I will have been reading this book for 2 months.' 
This means that you won't have finished the book  
我已经读这本书两个月了。”  这

and you simply cannot replace, 'will 
have been reading' with 'will have read'.
并且您根本无法将“将一直在
阅读”替换为“将已阅读”。

It's not an ongoing action. If you did, the 
sentence would not be grammatically correct  
这不是一个持续的行动。如果这样

because 'will have read' means you will be 
finished reading, but you are not. Okay, those  
因为“will have read”意味着您将读完

are your 4 future tenses. Sorry grammar police! 
There are of course other ways to talk about the  
是你的 4 个将来时。对不起语法警察

future apart from 'will'. And we're going to 
look at them now using my Wheel of Fortune.
未来除了‘意志’之外。我们现在将
使用我的命运之轮来查看它们。

Or actually, I should call it my 
Wheel of Future. As you can see,  
或者实际上，我应该称其为我

we have 'will' in one corner, which 
I've already talked about, below that,  
我们在一个角落里有“意志”，

we have 'to be going to'. And the structure 
there is 'be going to' + base verb. We used  
我们必须“要去”。结构是“begoingto”+

'to be going to' in 2 main ways—to make 
predictions based on present evidence.
“将要” 主要有两种方式——
根据现有证据做出预测。

For example—'John is so drunk! He's going 
to have a terrible hangover tomorrow,' or  
例如——‘约翰喝醉了！他明天

to talk about plans and intentions. 'I'm 
going to spend the day at home tomorrow,  
谈论计划和意图。 “明天

just chilling.' When the verb 
in the infinitive is 'go',  
只是令人不寒而栗。当不定式

we often shorten the sentence 'I'm going (to go) 
shopping later'. Just get rid of 'to go'. Now,  
我们经常缩短“我稍后要去购物”这句话

this looks like the present continuous, which is 
actually the next tense on my Wheel of Future.
这看起来像现在进行时，实际上是我
的未来之轮上的下一个时态。

We use the present continuous to talk about plans 
and arrangements. Yeah, plans again. We're making  
我们使用现在进行时来谈论计划和安排

plans for the future. There is often little 
difference between the present continuous and  
对未来的计划。现在进行时和现在

'to be going to' when we're talking about plans. 
However, when we use the present continuous,  
当我们谈论计划时，“将要”。  然而

we have made a firm decision to do something. 
And what do I mean by a firm decision?
我们已经下定决心要做某事。那么我所说
的坚定的决定是什么意思呢？

It usually means I know exactly what I'm 
doing, where, when and with whom. Often,  
这通常意味着我确切地知道自己在做什么、

but not always. We have arranged to 
do something. Look at these examples:  
但并非总是如此。我们已安排

'I am having lunch with my friend Claire 
tomorrow,'—that's an arrangement. 'We're  
“明天我要和我的朋友克莱尔共进

spending the summer on a yacht in Croatia.' 
Probably booked, but if not very definitely  
在克罗地亚的一艘游艇上度过了夏天。

happening. You could say—'We're going to 
spend the summer on a yacht in Croatia.'
正在发生。你可以说——“我们将在克罗地亚
的游艇上度过这个夏天。”

This is a plan, but it's less likely that you've 
booked it. It feels just slightly less certain  
这是一个计划，但您预订的可能性

than when we use the present continuous. 
We don't use the present continuous to  
比我们使用现在进行时。  我们

make predictions when an event is outside of 
our control. 'The sky is so dark it's going  
当事件超出我们的控制范围时做出预测

to rain in a few minutes.' We don't say—'It's 
raining in a few minutes'—because the weather,  
几分钟后就会下雨。”我们不会说“

unfortunately, is not in my control or yours, 
but especially in British people's control.
不幸的是，这不在我或你的控制范围内，
但尤其是在英国人的控制范围内。

It's just not. We just have no control over 
the weather. It is one of the worst things of  
事实并非如此。我们根本无法控制
天气。这是最糟糕的事情之一

living in Britain. Every picnic ruined. 
Every wedding. Look how British I am,  
住在英国。每次野餐都毁了。  每

just talking about the weather. By the way, 
I'm doing something very, very British here,  
只是谈论天气。顺便说一句，我在这里

which is complaining about the weather. And 
I've just said it's not in my control, yet
这是在抱怨天气。我刚刚说过
这不在我的控制范围之内

here I am again. I like the weather ruined 
my summer this year. It can't happen  
我又来了。我喜欢今年的天气毁了

again. Anyway, back to the lesson. Back to the 
present continuous. We also don't use it to talk  
再次。无论如何，回到教训。回到现在

about permanent situations in the future. 'We are 
going to live in the countryside for the rest of  
关于未来的永久情况。 “

our lives.' We wouldn't say—'We are living in 
the countryside for the rest of our lives.'
我们的生活。’我们不会说‘我们
要在乡下度过余生。’

'We are going to live.' And finally, I want to 
talk about the present simple. Another tense that,  
“我们要活下去。”最后，我想
谈谈一般现在时。另一个时态是，

rather confusingly, we use to talk about 
the future. We use the present simple to  
令人困惑的是，我们常常谈论

talk about timetabled or scheduled events. 
'Our plane leaves at 2:10 tomorrow morning.'  
谈论时间表或预定的事件。  “我们

'The exam finishes at 7, so pick me up 
then.' Right, those are the 4 future  
“考试七点结束，到时候来接我

tenses and some different ways we can talk 
about the future using other structures.

谈论未来的一些不同方式。

What do you think? Do you find it easier 
to think of the future as a tense? Maybe  
你怎么认为？您是否发现将未来

you disagree with me and that's absolutely 
fine. I'm open to hearing your opinions. Just  
你不同意我的观点，那绝对没问题

leave them in the comments and everyone 
just be nice to each other, please.
将它们留在评论中，请
大家彼此友善。

Yeah, that's right! There is technically no 
such thing as the future tense in English.
是的，没错！从技术上讲，英语
中不存在将来时这样的东西。

If that was news to you, I'm 
guessing you need to recap  
如果这对您来说是新闻，

Okay, time for the big reveal, our most 
common verb tense making up nearly 60% of

all English communication is—drumroll—the 
present simple. We then have that followed  
所有的英语交流都是——鼓乐——

by the past simple at close to 20%,

As you just learned, the present simple makes 
up a large portion of daily communication and  
正如您刚刚了解到的，一般现在时构成

rightfully so. We live in the present, after 
all. Let's look at some of the most common  
理所应当的。毕竟，我们生活在当下

uses of the present simple. Firstly, we use 
it to talk about facts and statements that  
一般现在时的用法。首先，我们

also use it for statements

As you can probably tell from our examples,  
走到拐角处然后左转。”  从我们

these kinds of statements and questions make 
up a large portion of our daily conversations,  
这类陈述和问题构成了我们

so it's no wonder why the present simple topped 
our list. Next up, we have the past simple.
因此，难怪现在简单时在我们的列表中名列
前茅。接下来，我们有简单过去时。

Of course, this is the second most used 
verb tense because we use it to talk about  
当然，这是第二常用的动词

completed actions in the past, and we sure 
do love to talk about the past. Look at a

发生在特定时间附近。 “我今天

逐渐改变或改进的事物。

'The city is slowly becoming more eco-friendly,  
“这座城市正在慢慢变得更加环保，  

with new recycling programs and bike 
lanes.' Right, that about does it for me.
有了新的回收计划和自行车道。”
是的，这对我来说就足够了。

So, those 5 tenses can get you a 
long way in English. But of course  
所以，这 5 种时态可以让你在

you have to learn all the tenses to 
become completely fluent in English.
你必须学习所有的时态才
能完全流利地讲英语。

Don't worry, I've put them in the ebook.

Next, I'm going to give you a taste of the grammar 
you need to know at each level—B1, B2, and C1.
接下来，我将向您介绍每个级别（B1、B2
和 C1）需要了解的语法。

We are going to compare 3 
different levels in English—B1,  
我们将比较 3 个不同

B2 and C1. B1 is intermediate level, 
B2 is upper-intermediate level and C1  
B2 和 C1。 B1 为中级
，B2 为中高级，C1

is that almighty advanced level 
of English. More specifically,  
就是那种万能的高级英语

we're going to be looking at the grammar at 
these levels. But what do those levels even mean?
我们将研究这些级别的语法。
但这些水平到底意味着什么？

Well, there are 6 language levels as defined 
by the CEFR, The Common European Framework of  
嗯，CEFR（欧洲共同语言框架

Reference, and they start at A1 beginner and go 
all the way up to C2, which is proficiency. Today,  
参考，他们从 A1 初学者开始，一直

we're looking at B1, B2 and C1, and a 
really common struggle for learners of  
我们正在研究 B1、B2 和 C1，以及学习者

any language is knowing which level you're at 
and which level you should be working towards.
任何语言都知道您处于哪个级别
以及您应该朝哪个级别努力。

If you don't know your level, it's nearly 
impossible to choose the right course,  
如果你不知道自己的水平，几乎

you improve. If you're already at B2, a B1-course  
或帮助您提高的学习材料或 YouTube 视频。

a C1-course would be a pretty bad idea and  
不会有太大帮助。如果您处于 B1 级，那么

this video, I'm going to give you some examples  
可能会让你终身放弃学习。在本视频

of the different grammatical structures 
you will learn to produce at each level.
你将学会在每个级别上运用
不同的语法结构。

I'm going to train you to really get to know 
the levels, to properly understand them,  
我将训练你真正了解这些级别

yourself, and you can make a smart  
这样您就可以准确地知道自己的位置

decision about the next steps that you 
take on your language learning journey.
决定您在语言学习之旅
中采取的后续步骤。

Right, let's get started with the grammar. First,  
好吧，让我们从语法开始吧。第一的，  

I want to talk about making deductions. 
So, we often use modal verbs like 'must'  
我想谈谈扣除的问题。  所以，我们

and 'might' to make deductions. But there 
are other structures that we can use too.  
和“可能”进行扣除。但我们

Look at these examples and see if you can 
tell how they're getting more advanced.
查看这些示例，看看您是否能看出
它们是如何变得更加先进的。

B1—'I haven't seen Lucy for weeks. 
She must be ill.' B2—'Actually,  
B1——“我已经好几个星期没见到露西了。”

I think she might have gone away for 
the winter.' And C1—'The odds are she's  
我想她可能已经出去过冬了

hightailed it to Spain for a few months. She's 
always banging on about doing that.' It's true,  
并把它带到了西班牙几个月。她总是喋喋不休

I am. It's my dream to be in Spain. In the B1 
example, you saw a present modal of deduction 
我是。 去西班牙是我的梦想。在 B1
示例中，你看到了当前的演绎模式

'must be'. In the B2 sentence, you saw a past 
modal of deduction 'might have gone', and at  
'必须是'。在 B2 句子中，您看到了过去的

C1 you didn't see a modal verb at all. I used the 
structure 'the odds are' to say that something is  
C1 你根本没有看到情态动词。我使用“the

very likely to be true. You can also see the 
vocabulary getting much more advanced at C1,  
很有可能是真的。您还可以看到

as well. Okay, there's lots more to learn 
about that, but I think that's a good start.
也一样。好的，还有很多东西需要学习
，但我认为这是一个好的开始。

Next, I want to talk about conditional 
sentences. Let's go through those levels  
接下来，我想谈谈条件句。

again and see how using conditionals 
changes from B1 to B2 to C1. These  
再次查看条件语句的使用如何从

sentences are all about fitness. B1—'If 
I were you, I'd work on building muscle.'  
句子都是关于健身的。 B1——“如果

B2—'I know I would be in much better shape if 
I'd started working out when I was younger.' And  
B2——“我知道，如果我年轻时就开始

C1—'But for my husband's encouragement, I would 
never have started going to the gym at all!'
C1——“如果不是我丈夫的鼓励，我
根本不会开始去健身房！”

So in the B1 sentence, I used a second 
conditional to give advice. 'If I were you,  
因此，在 B1 句子中，我使用了第二

I would work on.' Notice the use of 'were' instead 
of 'was' with the pronoun 'I'. Using 'were' is an  
我会继续努力。请注意与代词“I”一起使用

example of the subjunctive mood, which expresses 
hypothetical situations. In the B2 sentence,  
虚拟语气的例子，它表达假设

I used a mixed conditional to say how 
something in the past can affect the present.
我使用了混合条件来表示
过去的事情如何影响现在。

I used 'would be' in the second conditional 
and 'had started' in the third conditional.  
我在第二个条件中使用了“将是”，在

And in the C1 sentence, you can see a third 
conditional with the structure 'but for'  
在 C1 句子中，您可以看到第三个

standing in for an 'if phrase'. Again, there is 
so much more to learn about conditionals at each  
代表“if 短语”。再说一次，关于

level. That's just a small glimpse. Next, let's 
talk about the future at B1, B2, and C1 levels.
等级。这只是一个小小的一瞥。接下来
，我们来谈谈B1、B2和C1级别的未来。

You need to be able to talk about the future in 
different ways. We're going to take a look in the  
您需要能够以不同的方式

context of the environment. B1—'Sea levels will 
continue to rise over the coming decades.' Nice  
环境背景。 B1——“未来几十年

and simple. B2—'By 2050, many scientists believe 
that sea levels will have risen by around 30 cm in  
而且简单。 B2—“到 2050 年，许多科学家

the US.' C1—'Some coastal communities in Louisiana 
and Florida are on the brink of catastrophe.'
美国。 C1——“路易斯安那州和佛罗里达州的
一些沿海社区正处于灾难的边缘。”

In B1, you can see the future with 'will' to 
make a prediction, nice and simple. Notice that  
在B1中，你可以用“意志”看到未来

it's followed by 'continue' in the base form 
and then 'continue' is followed by 'to rise',  
其后是基本形式的“继续”，然后

the infinitive. Verb patterns, -ing verbs and 
infinitives are a really important element of  
不定式。动词模式、-ing 动词和

B1 and the levels after that. In B2, you can see 
the future perfect simple, 'will have risen'.
B1 及其之后的级别。在 B2 中，您可以看到
简单的将来完成时，“将会升起”。

We use it to talk about something that will be 
completed by a certain time in the future. In  
我们用它来谈论将在未来某

the C1 sentence, we're missing the obvious 
future tense words like 'will'. Instead,  
C1 句中，我们缺少明显的将来

we have the phrase 'to be on the brink 
of'. At C1, you are expected to use a  
我们有短语“处于边缘”。

variety of expressions like this to talk 
about future events. The next construction  
像这样谈论未来事件的各种

I want to talk about is the passive 
voice, and I want to talk about sushi.
我想谈谈的是被动语态
，我想谈谈寿司。

I love looking at topics like the environment, 
fitness—next topic, sushi! Here we go: B1—'This  
我喜欢看环境、健身等话题——下一

sushi was prepared by a top chef.' The B2—'It 
is widely believed that sushi originally comes  
寿司是由顶级厨师准备的。” B2——“

from Japan.' And C1—'Jack recalled having been 
told that sushi actually originated in China.'  
来自日本。’ C1——“杰克回忆起有
人说过寿司实际上起源于中国。”

Remember, we use the passive voice to shift the 
focus from the subject performing an action to the  
请记住，我们使用被动语态将焦点

subject receiving an action. In the B1 sentence, 
you can see a sentence in the passive voice
接受动作的主体。在 B1 句子中，您
可以看到一个被动语态的句子

in the past simple 'was prepared'. For B2, we 
can see an impersonal passive construction.  
过去简单的“准备好了”。对于 B2，我们

'It is widely believed that', we use this 
construction to say that people believe this,  
“人们普遍相信”，我们用这个

but not necessarily the speaker. It's 
very diplomatic. A politician might use  
但不一定是说话者。这非常

it. And at C1, we see a passive -ing form, 
'recalled having been told'. The verb 'to  
它。在 C1 处，我们看到一个被动的 -ing 形式

recall' is followed by an -ing verb, and 
by the passive voice in this sentence.
在这句话中，recall 后面跟着一个 -ing
动词，然后是被动语态。

Finally, I want to talk about adjectives and 
you start using adjectives right from A1 level,  
最后，我想谈谈形容词，你从

the very first beginner level. But as 
you move to higher levels in English,  
第一个初学者级别。但当你的

you are expected to move beyond—'Flying is scary.'
你应该超越“飞行是可怕的”。

So, let's talk about flying at B1, B2 and C1 
levels. So, B1—'Flying is much less scary than  
那么，我们来谈谈 B1、B2 和 C1 级别的飞行

I imagined.' B2—'The thought of it was utterly 
terrifying.' And C1—'For me, flying is not so much  
我想象的。 B2——“这个想法真是太可怕了。”

alarming as dull.' So B1 we use words like 'much' 
and 'slightly' in addition to basic comparative  
令人震惊又无趣。’因此，B1 我们除了使用基本
的比较级之外，还使用“much”和“slightly”等词

adjectives—to move beyond A2 level and show 
big and small differences—'much less scary'.
形容词——超越 A2 级别并显示大大小小
的差异——“不那么可怕”。

At B2 level, we use adverb - adjective 
collocations to add some spice to our  
在 B2 级别，我们使用副词-形容词搭配

descriptions. 'Utterly terrifying', not 
'bitterly' or 'entirely terrifying'. For example,  
描述。 “非常可怕”，而不是

'utterly terrifying' is a lovely collocation, 
they just fit together. It's what native speakers  
“非常可怕”是一个可爱的搭配，它们非常

would naturally reach for. We talk a lot about 
adverbs and adjective collocations in our B2  
自然会伸手去拿。我们在 B2 中谈论

programme. I'll leave information for my B1, B2, 
and C1 Programmes in the description box as well,
程序。我还将在说明框中留下我
的 B1、B2 和 C1 计划的信息，

in case you're interested. At C1 level, 
we use a range of advanced comparative  
如果你感兴趣的话。在 C1 级别
，我们使用一系列高级比较级

structures to compare things 
'not so much alarming as dull',  
比较事物的结构“与其说是令

meaning it's boring not scary. Okay, 
has that given you some idea of the  
这意味着它很无聊并不可怕。好的，

grammatical structures and phrases you 
typically learn at B1, B2, and C1 level?
您通常在 B1、B2 和 C1 级别学习
的语法结构和短语是什么？

This is a big lesson, but they do share a lot of 
characteristics. So, seeing them all together can  
这是一个重要的教训，但它们确实有很多

make them easier to learn and remember. Let's go 
through them first. We have the present simple—'I

Then we move on to the past simple—'I

然后我们转向过去简单的话题——“我吃

正在吃巧克力。过去完成时——“我吃

I can't help but go—'I had eaten.' And

you see how many similarities there 
are between all of these tenses? Now,  
你知道这些时态之间有多少

let's look a little more closely. Starting 
with the present tenses, the first tense  
让我们仔细看看。从现在

that you learn in English is usually the 
present simple, and that's for good reason.
你用英语学习的内容通常是一般
现在时，这是有充分理由的。

It's actually the tense that native 
speakers use in around 50% of their  
这实际上是母语人士在大约
50% 的话语中使用的时态

written and spoken communication. We do use 
the other present tenses quite often too,  
书面和口头交流。我们也经常

so they are all really, really important. The 
present simple—'I work on Tuesdays.' This is  
所以它们都非常非常重要。现在简单语

used to talk about general statements, habits 
and facts. The present continuous—'I am working  
用于谈论一般性陈述、习惯和事实
。现在进行时——“我正在工作

now.' This is used to talk about 
actions that are happening right now.
现在。' 这是用来谈论
正在发生的动作。

The present perfect—'I have worked at a pub.' 
We use this to talk about past events or past  
现在完成时——“我在一家酒吧工作过。”

actions that have present consequences 
and the present perfect continuous—'I  
具有现在后果的行为和现在
完成进行时——“我

have been working for three hours today.' 
This is used to talk about an action that  
今天已经工作了三个小时。”

started in the past and continues to the 
present. Okay, the structure of the present
从过去开始并持续到现在
。好的，现在的结构

simple like its name, it is fairly simple. We 
have the subject + the base form of a verb,  
simple 就像它的名字一样，相当简单。

except from in the third person singular. 
And this always catches my students out  
除了第三人称单数。  这总是

when they're relatively new to learning 
English. In the third person singular,  
当他们刚开始学习英语时。

we add an 's'. So for—I, you, we, they, 
it's—'I work', 'we eat', 'they play', 'you do'.
我们添加一个“s”。所以对于我、你、我们、他们来说
，就是“我工作”、“我们吃饭”、“他们玩”、“你做”。

But for—he, she, and it, it is—'she works', 'he 
cleans', 'it smells'. Another exception is 'be',  
但对于——他、她，还有它——“她工作”、“他打扫

the verb 'to be'. 'To be' has its own 
forms in the present simple. 'I am',  
动词“是”。 “To be”在一般现在

'you are', 'he, she, it is', 'we 
are', 'they are'. As I said before,  
“你是”，“他，她，是”，“我们

we use the present simple to talk about 
general statements, facts and habits.
我们用一般现在时来谈论一般
的陈述、事实和习惯。

We also use it to talk about scheduled events 
like plane and train times. Here are some  
我们还用它来谈论预定的活动，例如

examples. 'I am a woman. My name is Lucy.' This 
is a general statement or fact. 'Mary meets her  
例子。 '我是一个女人。我的名字是露西。这

friends on Friday evenings.' That's a habit. 
'The train to London leaves at 8 pm.' That's  
周五晚上和朋友们一起。”这是一个习惯。

a scheduled event in the future. 'Our dog 
eats the cat's food', and that's a habit.
未来预定的事件。 “我们的狗吃猫
的食物”，这是一种习惯。

A habit—we're trying to conquer at 
the moment. We don't know why he  
一种习惯——我们现在正在努力克服

started doing it, but he has since we moved house.
开始这样做，但自从我们搬家后他就这样做了。

Right, let's move on to the present continuous.
好的，我们继续讨论现在进行时。

We use the present continuous to talk about things 
that are happening at the moment of speaking,  
我们使用现在进行时来谈论说话

but be careful. In general, there is an exception. 
We can't use state verbs. Words like 'hate',  
但要小心。一般来说，有一个例外。  我们不

'love', 'want', for example. There is 
an exception there, and I will mention  
例如，“爱”、“想要”。

it. It's to do with slang. The structure of the 
present continuous is subject + be + verb -ing.
它。 这与俚语有关。现在进行
时的结构是主语+be+动词-ing。

It rhymes subject + 'be' + verb -ing. You 
can use that! Here are some examples—'I  
它押韵主语 + 'be' + 动词 -ing。您可以

am teaching English.' 'They are baking 
cookies.' We can also use this tense  
我正在教英语。 “他们正在烤饼干

to talk about things that we think are 
temporary. Compare these two sentences:  
谈论我们认为暂时的事情

'James lives in Manchester.' 'James is 
living in Manchester.' In the first sentence,  
“詹姆斯住在曼彻斯特。” “詹姆斯

I use the present simple because I think 
that his state is more or less permanent.
我使用一般现在时是因为我认为
他的状态或多或少是永久的。

But in the second sentence, I use the present 
continuous because I think his situation might  
但在第二句中，我使用现在进行

be temporary. He's living in Manchester now, 
but I don't know what might happen in a few  
是暂时的。他现在住在曼彻斯特
，但我不知道几天后会发生什么

weeks or months. Perhaps he's studying there, 
or he's working there for a short time. Now,  
几周或几个月。也许他正在那里学习，或者

you will hear native speakers use state 
verbs in the present continuous in this form
您会听到母语人士以这种形式
使用现在进行时的状态动词

or to show this meaning—'I am loving my christmas 
jumper right now.' 'Love' is a state verb. I'm not  
或者表达这个意思——“我现在很喜欢我的圣诞

meant to use it, but it means right now, a trend 
that I'm enjoying is my christmas jumper, which I  
本来打算使用它，但这意味着现在我喜欢

must say I think is… I think this is a very nice 
christmas jumper. I actually had another option  
必须说我认为是……我认为这是一件非常漂亮

today. It was between this one, which I wore last 
year, but I got this one on a secondhand website.
今天。介于我去年穿的这一件之间，
但我在二手网站上买了这一件。

Very happy with myself. Anyway, back to the 
tenses. You'll also hear people say—'Oh no,  
对自己非常满意。无论如何，回到时态

I'm hating that song right now.' It means 
it's a temporary state. For some reason,  
我现在讨厌那首歌。这意味着这是

right now I don't enjoy that song, temporarily. 
I'm hating it! So when you hear a teacher say,  
现在我暂时不喜欢那首歌。  我讨厌

never use a state verb in the present 
continuous—take that with a pinch of salt.
永远不要在现在进行时使用状态
动词——对此持保留态度。

We also use the present continuous to talk about 
arrangements. This means that we are planning to  
我们也使用现在进行时来谈论
安排。这意味着我们计划

do something in the future and it involves another 
person or business. Let me show you an example:  
将来做某事并且涉及另一个人或
企业。让我给你举个例子：

'I am having my haircut on Tuesday.' 'Sarah is 
meeting her parents tomorrow.' There are plans,  
“周二我要去理发。” “莎拉明天

but they depend on someone else. 
Let's take a look at some examples:
但他们依赖别人。  让
我们看一些例子：

'Kate is studying business,' temporary situation, 
happening now. 'We are meeting our friend next  
“凯特正在学习商科”，这是暂时的情况，现在

Friday in Edinburgh,' arrangement involving 
someone else. 'We are driving home,' we are  
星期五在爱丁堡，”涉及其他人的安排

doing this right now, in the moment. 'It is 
snowing,' for example. It did actually snow  
现在就做这件事。例如，“

the other day. It was magical. But enough about 
my weather. Let's move on to the present perfect.
日前。这太神奇了。关于我的天气
就够了。让我们继续现在完成时。

The structure of the present perfect is subject 
+ 'has' or 'have' + the past participle. There  
现在完成时的结构是主语+“has”

are 3 main ways that we use the present perfect 
in English. The first is to talk about things  
我们在英语中使用现在完成时的三

that started in the past and continue 
to the present. It's very important to  
从过去开始并持续到

remember that they are unfinished actions. 
When we talk about these events or states,  
请记住，它们是未完成的动作。  当

we often mention how long they've been 
going on for or when they started.
我们经常提到它们已经持续了
多长时间或何时开始。

For example—'I have lived in the UK all 
my life,' or 'She has been at university  
例如，“我一生都住在英国

since 2020.' 'William and I have 
been married for two months'—oh,  
自 2020 年起。’ “我和威廉
结婚两个月了”——哦，

three months. Oh, it's a three month 
anniversary nearly. How exciting! The  
三个月。哦，马上就要三个月周年

second way that we use the present perfect 
is to talk about our experiences up to the  
我们使用现在完成时的第二

present. When we do this, we don't talk 
about exactly when something happened.
展示。当我们这样做时，我们不会谈论
事情发生的确切时间。

We are just generally telling somebody about our 
life experiences. For example—'She has been to  
我们通常只是向某人讲述我们的

Canada 3 times.' 'We have met the Queen.' 'I have 
read all of the Harry Potter books.' Finally,  
加拿大3次。 “我们见过女王了。” “我读完

we also use the present perfect to 
talk about past events and actions  
我们还使用现在完成时来

that have consequences in the present. 
For example—'I have eaten breakfast so  
这对现在有影响。  例如——“

I'm not hungry,' or 'Mike has lost his 
keys so he's going to be late for work.'
我不饿”或者“迈克丢了钥匙
，所以他上班会迟到”。

Let's move on to the last of the presents. 
The present perfect continuous. I've just  
让我们继续看最后一份礼物。  现在

realised I look like a present and I'm 
talking about the present tenses. Maybe  
意识到我看起来像一个礼物，而且

I should have just made a video about the 
present tenses dressed as present. Now we  
我应该制作一个关于现在

use the present perfect continuous to talk 
about something that started in the past and  
使用现在完成进行时来谈论

continues to the present, and that 
might sound very similar to the present
一直延续到现在，这听起来
可能与现在非常相似

perfect. But there are a few key differences. 
One big difference is the structure. We use  
完美的。但有一些关键的区别。  一

the structure subject + 'has/have' 
+ 'been' + verb -ing. 'I have been  
结构主语 + 'has/have' + 'been'

eating chocolate,' as we discussed before. 
Now with the present perfect continuous,  
吃巧克力，”正如我们之前讨论过的

we often use it to talk about things that we 
have been doing uninterrupted that haven't  
我们经常用它来谈论我们一直在不

finished. We use this tense to emphasise 
how long something has been happening.
完成的。我们使用这种时态来强调
某件事已经发生了多长时间。

For example—'I've been watching that TV 
show for weeks.' I'm emphasising how long  
例如——“我已经看了那个电视节目
好几个星期了。”我强调的是多久

I have been watching the TV show. Or—'Ellen 
has been replying to emails for two hours  
我一直在看电视节目。或者——“艾伦

already.' We use it to talk about things 
that have been done recently or lately. For  
已经。' 我们用它来谈论最近

example—'Look! It's been snowing!' Or—'I've been 
practising my football skills a lot recently.'
例如——‘看！下雪了！或者——“我
最近经常练习我的足球技能。”

That's such a lie! Remember, we generally 
don't use the present perfect continuous  
这真是一个谎言！请记住，我们

to talk about states. You wouldn't say—'I 
have been belonging to a band for a long  
谈论状态。你不会说——“我已经

time.' You would say—'I have belonged 
to a band for a long time.' Some more  
时间。'你会说——“我已经加入一

examples—'They've been trying to call you all 
day,' or 'She hasn't been feeling well lately.'
例如——“他们一整天都在给你打电话
”或“她最近感觉不太舒服”。

Okay, we made it through the present tenses. 
Let's move on to the past tenses. We'll have a  
好的，我们已经讲完了现在时态。  让

quick overview and then we'll go into more detail. 
We have the past simple. 'I worked abroad last  
快速概述，然后我们将详细介绍。  我们有

summer,' that talks about past, finished actions. 
We have the past continuous. 'I was working at 2  
夏天”，谈论过去、已经完成的动作。我们
有过去进行时。 “我当时在 2 点工作

pm yesterday,' that describes a continuing action 
at some point in the past. We have the past
昨天下午”，描述了过去某个时刻
的持续动作。我们还有过去

perfect. 'I had worked there for two years 
before I got my promotion.' That's used to  
完美的。 “在我获得晋升之前，我在

describe past actions that happened 
before another past action or time,  
描述在另一个过去的动作或时间

and we have the past perfect continuous. 'I 
had been working there for two years before  
我们有过去完成进行时。 “我之前

I finally got my promotion.' Very similar to the 
previous one, but we'll go into more detail. We  
我终于得到了晋升。与上一个非常相似

use the past perfect continuous to talk about past 
actions that continued to a past point in time.
使用过去完成进行时来谈论持续到
过去某个时间点的过去动作。

Let's start with the past simple. This one 
is nice and easy. It's the second most common  
让我们从简单过去时开始。这个

tense that English speakers use. We use it 
to talk about events that happened before  
说英语的人使用的时态。我们用

the present moment. These must be finished 
events or actions and we often say when they  
当下。这些必须是已完成的事件或

happened. Although that's not obligatory, the 
structure is the subject + regular verb -ed.
发生了。尽管这不是强制性的，但
结构是主语 + 常规动词 -ed。

However, lots and lots of verbs are 
irregular, and I do actually have a video  
然而，很多动词都是不规则

on some of the most common irregular 
verbs that could be really useful,  
一些最常见的不规则动词

so I will leave that link down in the 
description box. An example—'I went to  
所以我会将该链接保留在说明

bed at 10 pm last night,' or 'Denis ate a box of 
chocolates for breakfast.' Live your life, Denis!
昨晚 10 点睡觉”或“丹尼斯早餐吃了一
盒巧克力”。过你的生活，丹尼斯！

That sounds like my kind of breakfast. 
Another example—'My husband bought me  
这听起来像是我喜欢的早餐。  另

flowers last week.' Not true, though. Not 
true. Maybe next week. Okay, let's move  
上周送花。”但事实并非如此。不正确

on to the past continuous—the structure of this 
tense is subject + 'was' or 'were' + verb -ing.  
过去进行时——这种时态的结构是主语

We can use this tense to talk about actions 
or states. One way in which we use the past  
我们可以使用这种时态来谈论动作或

continuous is to say what was happening 
at a specific moment in the past.
连续是指过去某个特定
时刻发生的事情。

For example—'Tom was cooking dinner at 7 pm 
yesterday.' We can also use it to give background  
例如，“昨天晚上 7 点汤姆正在做

information about something. For example—'Will 
was speaking to me whilst I was trying to  
有关某事的信息。例如——“当我试图

record a video,' or 'It was snowing when I went 
outside.' We also use it to say that an ongoing  
录制视频’或‘我出门时正在下雪
。’我们还用它来表示正在进行的

action was interrupted by another action. In this 
case, it's usually paired with another clause.
动作被另一个动作打断。在这种情况
下，它通常与另一个子句配对。

in the past simple. 'We were eating dinner when 
he arrived.' We were eating dinner over this long  
过去简单。 “他到达时我们正在吃

period of time and he arrived right then. 
Or—'They were chatting about their holiday  
过了一段时间，他就到了。  或者

when Ben called them.' Let's move on to the past 
perfect. The past perfect tense is used to talk  
当本打电话给他们时。让我们继续讨论

about events that happened before another 
event or up to a certain time in the past.
关于在另一个事件之前或过去
某个时间发生的事件。

Again, it is often used with the past 
simple. The structure is as follows:  
同样，它经常与简单过去时

subject + 'had' + past participle. And 
if you don't do that when you say 'had',  
主语 + 'had' + 过去分词。如果你
在说“had”的时候没有这样做，

you're not my student. Let's take a look at 
some examples. 'When I arrived at the bus stop,  
你不是我的学生。让我们看一些

the bus had already left,' already happened. 
Or—'You had travelled to ten countries before  
公共汽车已经开走了，”已经发生了。

your second birthday,' or—'She had worked at 
the company for 5 years before it closed,'  
你的两岁生日，”或者——“她在公司关闭

or 'We had already eaten dinner so we 
weren't hungry when dinner was served.'
或“我们已经吃过晚饭了，所以
晚饭上桌时我们并不饿。”

Finally, let's discuss the past perfect 
continuous. The structure is subject + 'had  
最后，我们来讨论一下过去完成

been' + verb -ing. Now, the past perfect and 
the past perfect continuous, what a mouthful,  
是'+动词-ing。现在，过去完成时和

are often used interchangeably 
by native English speakers,  
经常被以英语为母语

there's no difference in overall meaning. 
Take a look at these 2 sentences. There's  
总体意义没有区别。  看看

no real difference in overall meaning. 
'I had worked there for 5 years when  
总体意义没有真正的区别。  “

the company closed,' or 'I had been working 
there for 5 years when the company closed.'
公司关闭了”或“公司关闭时我
已经在那里工作了 5 年”。

No real difference, we can say either. However, 
you should use the continuous form in these 2  
我们可以说没有真正的区别。但是，

situations. If you are talking about an 
action in the past that continued up to  
情况。如果您谈论

a certain time and continued after it, or 
if you're talking about a repeated action  
某个时间并在该时间之后继续，或者

that happened in the past up to a certain 
point, let's take a look at some examples.
这在过去某个时刻发生过
，让我们看一些例子。

That's it for today's lesson. 
I hope you enjoyed it. I hope  
今天的课程就到此为止。  我

you learnt something. I hope you 
learnt what your level might be.
你学到了一些东西。我希望
您了解自己的水平。

How did you do? Do you know your English 
level, or are you still not sure?
你做得怎么样？您知道自己的英语水平
吗？或者您仍然不确定吗？

Taking a look in the B1 to C1 ebook will 
definitely help you. You can see what  
查看 B1 到 C1 电子书肯定会对您

vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation 
you'll need to know for each level.
每个级别都需要了解词
汇、语法和发音。

Pronunciation is important for the tenses.
发音对于时态很重要。

I weave pronunciation throughout all my 
courses, so this complete tenses course  
我将发音贯穿于我所有的课程中

is no different. It's time for you to learn how 
to pronounce -ed endings perfectly every time.
没有什么不同。现在是您学习如何每次
都完美地发音 -ed 结尾的时候了。

You'll never have to think about whether 
it's 'danced, danced or danced' ever again.
您再也不用考虑它是“跳舞
、跳舞还是跳舞”。

I am going to teach you how 
to pronounce words like these,  
我将教你如何发音

words that end in -ed, d because 
it's not so straightforward.
以 -ed, d 结尾的单词，因为
它不那么简单。

We have 'wanted, danced and saved', 'wanted, 
danced, saved'. So there are 3 different ways  
我们“想要、跳舞、拯救”，“想要、

that we pronounce -ed at the end of a word. And 
there are so many words that end with -ed. We have  
我们在单词末尾发音-ed。而且有

the regular past simple verbs. We have the regular 
past perfect verbs, and we have many adjectives.  
常规过去简单动词。我们有规则的过去

So it's a bit frustrating that we have 3 different 
ways of pronouncing -ed at the end of words.
因此，我们有 3 种不同的方式在词尾
发音 -ed，这有点令人沮丧。

But I have a very simple trick that you can 
use to instantly know whether you end the  
但我有一个非常简单的技巧，你可以

word with /ɪd/, whether you end it with /t/, 
or whether you end it with /d/—/ɪd/ /t/ /d/.
以 /ɪd/ 结尾的单词，无论以 /t/ 结尾
，还是以 /d/—/ɪd/ /t/ /d/ 结尾。

So, let's get started with the lesson. I'm 
going to go through the method with lots of  
那么，让我们开始上课吧。我将

examples. And then I have got an activity, 
which is a story, which will allow you to  
例子。然后我有一个活动，这

put into practice what you've learned. It's a 
bit of a challenge. So let's see how you do.
将你所学到的付诸实践。这是一个有点挑战
。那么让我们看看你是怎么做的。

Let's take a look at some root 
words. We have -part, -end,  
让我们看一些词根。我们

-test and -need all of these end in /t/ or /d/. 
So, you're going to notice with this method,  
-test 和 -need 都以 /t/ 或 /d/ 结尾。
所以，你会注意到用这种方法，

it all depends on how the root word ends 
with which phoneme or sound does it end.  
这一切都取决于词根如何结尾，取决于
它以哪个音素或声音结尾。

In this case /t/ and /d/, which are nearly always 
represented by the letter 't' or the letter 'd',  
在本例中，/t/ 和 /d/ 几乎总是由

if a root word ends in /t/ or /d/, 
the -ed is pronounced as /ɪd/.
如果词根以 /t/ 或 /d/ 结尾
，则 -ed 发音为 /ɪd/。

This means that it adds on an extra syllable 
'part, parted', 'end, ended', 'test, tested',  
这意味着它添加了一个额外的音节“部分，分开

'need, needed.' That is the easy part. But what 
if a root word does not end /t/ or /d/? Well,  
“需要，需要。”这是最简单的部分。但是，如果

does it end with a vowel, a voiced consonant, 
or an unvoiced consonant? If the root word ends  
它以元音、浊辅音还是清辅音

with a vowel sound or with a voiced consonant 
sound, then the root word ends with voice,  
带有元音或浊辅音，则

meaning that when you produce that last phoneme, 
you can feel the vibrations in your throat.
这意味着当您发出最后一个音素时，
您可以感觉到喉咙的振动。

If it ends with an unvoiced consonant, you cannot 
feel the vibrations in your throat. Look at these  
如果它以清辅音结尾，您就感觉

4 root words. We have -dine, -love, -comply, 
-remember. Dine, I can feel the vibration. Love,  
4个词根。我们有-吃饭、-爱、-遵守、-

I can feel the vibration. Comply, that ends 
with a vowel sound. And remember, still with  
我能感觉到振动。 Comply，以元

voice. Remember that in Received Pronunciation if 
a word ends with 'r', the 'r' is not pronounced.
嗓音。 请记住，在标准发音中，如果单词
以“r”结尾，则不发音“r”。

In American English, you might say 'remember', 
but in Received Pronunciation 'remember',  
在美式英语中，你可能会说“remember”，
但在标准发音中“remember”

all of these root words end with voice. And 
the great thing is that we match voice with  
所有这些词根都以语音结尾

voice. If a word ends with voice apart 
from /d/, then we match it with voice.  
嗓音。如果一个单词以除 /d/ 之外的语音

So we added /d/ onto the end. Loved. Dined. 
Complied. Remembered. It would actually be  
所以我们在末尾添加了/d/。很喜欢。吃饭

more difficult to use /t/ at the end because 
you're moving from voiced to unvoiced, dined.
最后使用 /t/ 会更困难，因为你
要从浊音转向清音，dined。

Okay, so moving on to the root words that end 
with an unvoiced consonant. Take a look at  
好的，现在继续讨论以清辅音

these 4. We have clap, kick, dance and wash—/p/, 
/k/, /s/, /ʃ/. None of the endings have voice in  
这 4 个。我们有拍手、踢腿、跳舞和洗脸——/p/、/k/、/s/、/ʃ/。

them. Just like we matched voiced with 
voiced before. We match unvoiced with  
他们。就像我们之前将浊音与浊音

unvoiced. So in this case -ed is pronounced 
as /t/. Clapped. Kicked. Danced. Washed.
无声的。因此在这种情况下 -ed 发音为 /t/。
鼓掌。踢了。跳舞了。洗过。

Try ending these words with 
the /d/ sound. In my opinion,  
尝试用 /d/ 声音结尾这些

it's a lot more difficult. So that's the 
theory behind it all. Looking at the last  
这要困难得多。这就是这一切

sound in the root word and then working out what 
the next sound should be. With root words that end  
发音，然后计算出下一个发音

in any sound other than /t/ and /d/, There is 
no extra syllable. Love is not loved or loved.
在除/t/和/d/之外的任何声音中，没有额外
的音节。爱情不是被爱，就是被爱。

It's loved. Kicked isn't kicked or kicked. It's 
kicked. No extra syllable. But decide is decided,  
它被爱了。被踢不是被踢，也不是被踢。它被

extra syllable. Test is tested, extra 
syllable. Some students prefer to learn  
额外的音节。测试测试了，额外

words through studying them in lists, and 
other students prefer to hear them spoken  
通过在列表中学习单词，其他

and to practise to learn them in practice. We're 
going to go through both ways of learning them.
并在实践中练习学习它们。我们将
通过这两种方式来学习它们。

First, let's look at the list version. And then 
I will tell you a story using the words. And you  
首先我们来看一下列表版本。然后我

have to guess what the pronunciation is. Here 
are the sounds that come before /ɪd/ as -ed.
必须猜测发音是什么。以下是
/ɪd/ 之前的发音，如 -ed。

/t/, wanted, /d/, decided. And here we have 
the sounds that come before the /d/ as -ed.  
/t/，想要，/d/，决定。这里我们

We have /b/ as in robbed. /v/ as in lived. /z/ 
as in amazed. /g/ as in rigged. /n/ as in fined.  
我们有/b/，就像抢劫一样。 /v/ 如生活中那样

/m/ as in climbed./ƞ/ as in winged. /dʒ/ 
as in judged. /ð/ as in soothed. /l/ as  
/m/ 如同 climbed。/ƞ/ 如同 winged。 /dʒ/  如同
判断。 /ð/ 如同抚慰。 /l/ 作为

in called. And then I've included 
/r/ just so you know for American  
在被称为.然后我添加了 /r/ 只是

English pronunciation that it 
would be followed by the /d/.
英语发音它后面
会跟/d/。

For RP it isn't pronounced remembered, 
remembered. It's pronounced with /d/  
对于 RP，它不发音为“remembered”、“remembered”。

because it ends with a schwa vowel sound, 
which is voiced. But in American English,  
因为它以 schwa 元音结尾，这是

the 'r' is pronounced at the end of words 
and it would sound something like remembered,  
“r” 在单词末尾发音
，听起来像是记住了，

remembered. And then we have the sounds that come 
before /t/ as -ed, the unvoiced sounds. We have  
记得。然后我们有 /t/ as -ed 之前

/p/ as in helped, /f/ as in sniffed or laughed, 
/s/ as in missed or danced, /k/ as in asked.
/p/ 表示帮助，/f/ 表示嗅或笑，/s/ 表示
错过或跳舞，/k/ 表示询问。

I know some of my students struggle with that 
sound. The combination of /s/ /k/ /t/, asked,  
我知道我的一些学生对这种声音感到

asked. We have /tʃ/ as in matched. /ʃ/ as in 
washed. /θ/ as in unearthed. There aren't many  
问道。我们有/tʃ/作为匹配。 /ʃ/ 如

-ed words with the /θ/ at the end of the root 
word. Now, this rule also applies to adjectives,  
-ed 单词，其根词末尾带有 /θ/。现在

but there are many more exceptions. So, 
some adjectives ending in /t/ or /d/,  
但还有很多例外。因此，一些以

we have insulted or beaded adjectives 
ending in a voiced consonant or a vowel.
我们有以浊辅音或元音结
尾的侮辱或串珠形容词。

We have soothed or moved and unvoiced consonants 
distressed, astonished. There are lots of  
我们抚慰或感动，清辅音感到

irregular adjectives that don't follow this rule, 
and they favour /ɪd/ at the end. Naked. Wicked.  
不遵循此规则的不规则形容词，它们

Jagged. Rugged. There is normally a /g/ or /k/ 
sound at the end of the root word, but there  
锯齿状。崎岖。词根末尾通常

are exceptions to the exceptions. For example, 
beloved. Okay, now it is time for the activity.
都是例外中的例外。例如，亲爱的
。好了，现在是活动时间了。

I am going to read a story to you. 
It's filled with words that end in -ed,  
我要给你读一个故事。  它

and each time I reach a word that ends in -ed, 
I'm going to stop for a couple of seconds to give  
每次我遇到一个以 -ed 结尾的单词

you the chance to say how you think it might be 
pronounced, what ending you think it might have.
你有机会说出你认为它可能如何发音
，你认为它可能有什么结局。

'As I've told you before, 
I loved living in Seville.
“正如我之前告诉过你的，
我喜欢住在塞维利亚。

I always envisioned myself living 
there long term. I had also
我一直设想自己长期住在
那里。我也有过

住在马德里，但对于某些人来说

nearly everything I wanted. So I promised to  
塞维利亚的原因确实启发了我。它几乎

I moved back to the UK to finish my studies.
我自己说我将来会搬到那里。
我搬回英国完成学业。

When I finished, I rented a room from my parents

I will see you soon for another lesson. Muah!
我很快会再来和你见面，继续上另一堂课。么么哒！

Okay, you've got the pronunciation of regular 
past forms of verbs down. Well done! Make sure  
好的，您已经掌握了动词过去式

you don't forget any of that information. 
Don't worry, I've put it all in the ebook.
你不会忘记任何这些信息。  别担心，我
已经把所有内容都写在电子书中了。

However, there are lots of irregular verbs in 
English, so let's learn how to pronounce those.
然而，英语中有很多不规则动词，
所以让我们学习一下如何发音。

Now, I've got a mixture of a 
grammar and a pronunciation  
现在，我得到了语法

and a vocabulary lesson for you today. Today, 
we're going to be talking about the 25 most  
今天为您准备了词汇课。今天

common irregular verbs in the English language. 
Honestly, learning the irregular verbs isn't a  
英语中常见的不规则动词。  老实

very exciting experience. But if you want to 
learn to speak English, you have to do it.
非常令人兴奋的经历。但如果你想学习
说英语，你就必须这样做。

If you can master the pronunciation and the 
correct form of the top 25 irregular verbs, then  
如果你能掌握前25个不规则动词

you will be a step closer to fluency and a step 
closer to speaking English like a native speaker.
您将更接近流利的英语，更接近
像母语人士一样说英语。

I'm going to pronounce the infinitive form,  
我要发音不定式形式  

the past simple, and the 
participle twice for each verb.
过去简单，每个
动词有两次分词。

And I'll give you time to repeat 
after me. Now, I've said before,  
我会给你时间跟着我重复一遍

the absolute best way of learning to 
speak like a native is by imitating. So,  
学习像母语一样说话的绝对

I want you to copy or to imitate me. 
So I'm going to say the 3 forms. And  
我希望你复制或模仿我。  所以

I want you to repeat them with me. I'll 
say them again and then you repeat again.
我希望你跟我一起重复一遍。我会
再说一遍，然后你再重复一遍。

Now, the reason I'm saying all three together 
is because I want you to get them stuck in your  
现在，我之所以将这三者放在一起，

head—I want you to learn them in that order. 
You will be much more likely to remember them  
头——我希望你按照这个顺序学习它们

if you learn all 3 together. So let's get 
started. Number 1—to be—be was/were been, be  
如果你一起学习这三个。那么让我们开始

was/were been. Then we have—to have—have had had.
曾经/曾经。那么我们就必须——必须——已经拥有。

How is that? I hope you're feeling more 
confident in your pronunciation now.
怎么样？我希望您现在对自己
的发音更有信心了。

Pronunciation is weaved throughout 
my B1, B2 and C1 programmes,  
发音贯穿于我的 B1、B2

meaning that you always learn how to 
say something as well as what to say.
这意味着您总是要学习如何
说某事以及该说什么。

But now I think it's time to look 
at some tense adjacent grammar,  
但现在我觉得是时候看看
一些时态相邻语法了，

because the classic past tenses aren't 
the only way to talk about the past.
因为经典过去时并不是谈论
过去的唯一方式。

And believe me, most of my students need to 
watch this video. Let's learn about used to,  
相信我，我的大多数学生都需要观看

would be used to and get used to.
会习惯并习惯。

Today we are going to talk about used to,  
今天我们要聊的是习惯，  

use to. How are they different? Would, 
to be used to and to get used to.
用来。它们有何不同？
会，习惯并习惯。

If you have any doubts about the use of these 
then this lesson is for you. And of course,  
如果您对这些的使用有任何疑问，

I have a quiz. There will be a quiz at the end of  
我有一个测验。年底会有一个测验  

this lesson for you to test your 
learning. So stay till the end.
本课程旨在测试您的学习情况。
所以一定要坚持到最后。

Okay, let's talk about used to and use to. 
Firstly, let's focus on the pronunciation  
好吧，我们来谈谈used to和use to。

because I know this is very confusing for many 
students because when we say used on its own,  
因为我知道这对很多学生来说很令人
困惑，因为当我们说单独使用时，

we use the /z/ sound and the /d/ sound, used.
我们使用 /z/ 声音和 /d/ 声音。

But to say used to is quite a mouthful. 
So, you will hear speakers of English  
但要说“习惯”，那就有点拗口了。

saying /'juːs(t) tuː/, use to. That means 
that both used to and use to are pronounced  
说/'juːs(t) tuː/，用to。这意味

in the same way in normal conversation, 
used to, used to. This makes it slightly  
就像在正常谈话中一样，习惯

easier for you in spoken English, but in 
written English you do have to be careful.
英语口语对你来说比较容易，
但英语书面语你必须小心。

Let's focus on used to. We use 'used 
to' to talk about past habits that we  
让我们重点关注过去。我们用“used

don't do in the present or past 
states that are no longer true.  
不要在现在或过去的状态

Used to with the base form of a verb, 
also called the bare infinitive,  
用于与动词的基本形式一起使用

but I'm going to call it the base verb hit. 'I 
used to do yoga.' But now I don't have time.
但我将称之为基本动词 hit。 “我以前经常
做瑜伽。”但现在我没有时间。

'I used to go to a language school, but 
I finished the course.' 'I used to live  
“我曾经上过一所语言学校，但我已经
完成了课程。” “我曾经生活过

in Seville', but now I live in England. 
'I used to be a waitress,' but now I'm  
在塞维利亚”，但现在我住在英格兰。  “

a teacher. And that's an example of 
a state that's not talking about a  
一位老师。这是一个不

habit. Something like—'I used to have short 
hair,' that wasn't a habit that was a state.
习惯。比如——“我以前留着短发”，
这不是一种习惯，而是一种状态。

So, that's using 'used' with the 'd' at 
the end. But you will see that people  
因此，这就是使用“used”并在末尾

use 'used' with no 'd' at the end. This 
is a point of confusion for many of my  
使用末尾不带“d”的“used”。对于我

students. In questions and negatives, we use 
use instead. 'I didn't used to like avocados',  
学生。在疑问句和否定句中，我们使用

but now I love them. 'Did you 
used to work at the corner shop?'
但现在我爱他们。 “你以前
在街角小店工作过吗？”

He didn't used to care about his appearance, 
but now he takes pride in it. 'Did they used  
以前他并不在意自己的外表，但现在

to go to the same school as us?' It's 
worth noting that when you use never,  
和我们去同一所学校？值得注意

you do use 'used' with the 'd'. 'He didn't used 
to care about his appearance.' 'He never used to  
你确实将“used”与“d”一起使用。 “他过去

care about his appearance.' We will do lots 
of testing of this in the quiz at the end.
关心他的外表。我们将在最后的
测验中对此进行大量测试。

But now it's time to talk about would. When 
somebody is telling a story about the past,  
但现在是时候谈谈意愿了。

you might hear them use would 
+ base verb. 'When I lived in  
你可能会听到他们使用 will

Seville, we would eat lunch at 4 
pm.' 'When I was studying Spanish,  
塞维利亚，我们下午 4 点吃午餐

I would watch Spanish TV shows.' Now you might 
think, ah, so it's the same as you used to.
我会看西班牙电视节目。现在你可能
会想，啊，原来和以前一样啊。

Not exactly! We can't use would + base verb 
to talk about past states. Only past habits.  
不完全是！我们不能使用 will + 基本动词

An example—'I would have short hair,' does 
not mean the same thing as—'I used to have  
例如，“我会留短发”与“
我以前留过”的意思不一样

short hair.' Or—'I would live in Seville.' Does 
not mean the same thing as—'I used to live in  
短发。或者——“我会住在塞维利亚

Seville.' So, remember would + base verb is only 
appropriate for past habits or repeated actions.
塞维利亚。因此，记住 will + 基本动词
仅适用于过去的习惯或重复的动作。

Let's move onto 'to be used to'. When we want 
to talk about things that we are accustomed to,  
让我们继续讨论“习惯”。当我们

or things that feel normal to us. We 
use to be + used to + verb -ing. An  
或我们觉得正常的事情。我们使用“be”+“

example—'I'm used to running in cold 
weather, so I don't mind it.' I'm  
例如——“我习惯在寒冷的天气里跑步

accustomed to running in cold weather. It 
feels normal to me to run in cold weather.
习惯在寒冷的天气里跑步。对我来说，
在寒冷的天气里跑步感觉很正常。

Another example—My fiance Will is used to 
working hard, so when we go on holiday he  
另一个例子——我的未婚夫威尔习惯于努力

becomes restless.' Working hard is normal

We're going to move on to something really tricky,

几乎，我们使用它们的所有方式。现在

long grammar lesson on this channel before. I want 
you to feel like you're in a classroom with me  
我之前在这个频道上讲过很长的语法课。
我想让你感觉就像和我一起在教室里

going through the full process of learning 
about have been, has been and had been.
经历学习过去、过去和
过去的完整过程。

Let me know if you like it. Now, let's start with 
some tenses and constructions. In this lesson,  
如果你喜欢的话请告诉我。现在，让我们
从一些时态和结构开始。在本课中，

I am going to mention the present 
perfect simple. The present perfect  
我要提到现在完成
时。现在完成时

continuous. The past perfect simple, 
the past perfect continuous, and the  
连续的。过去完成时、

passive voice. And I'm not going to explain 
these tenses and constructions in detail,  
被动语态。我不会详细解释

because the focus today is on using 
have been, has been and had been.
因为今天的重点是使用 has
was、has 和 had was。

Okay, first I'm going to talk about the basics we  
好的，首先我要谈谈我们的基础知识  

use 'have been' and 'has been' in 
the present perfect tenses—I, you,  
使用现在完成时态的“have be”

we, they and plural nouns go with have been—I 
have been, you have been, the books have been.
我们、他们和复数名词与have been搭配——我
曾经存在、你曾经存在、书曾经存在。

My parents have been. He, she, it 
and singular and uncountable nouns  
我的父母曾经是。他、她、

go with has been—she has been, it has 
been, London has been. The bread has  
一直是——她一直是，伦敦

been. Bread is uncountable. We use had 
been with all subjects, nice and easy,  
到过。 面包是不可数的。我们使用 had
been 处理所有科目，简单又方便，

in the past perfect tenses. I had been. He had 
been. Our children had been. The tea had been.
过去完成时态。我曾经是。他曾经是。
我们的孩子曾经是。茶本来就是。

How can I not bring up tea? I'm British. All 
subjects in the past perfect tenses. Now,  
怎么能不提茶呢？我是英国人。所有主语

let's move on to positive and negative 
sentences and questions. In positive sentences,  
让我们继续讨论肯定句和否定

the structure is subject + have/has or had been, 
nice and simple. In negative sentences, we put  
结构是主语+有/已经或曾经，很好而且

'not' between have, has or had and been—subject 
have/has or had not been. In questions,
have、has 或 had 和 be 之间的“not”——主语
has/has 或 had not be。在提问中，

we invert the subject word order and we put, 
have, has or had before the subject. Have,  
我们颠倒主语词序，将、have、has

has or had + subject + been. Now, I want to 
note here that we can use been to be as a main  
已经或曾经+主语+曾经。现在，我想在

verb or an auxiliary verb. As a main verb, it 
expresses the state or action being described.  
动词或助动词。作为主要动词，

It is not followed by another verb, and you will 
see this later in the video in sentences like—'I  
它后面没有其他动词，您稍后会在视频

have been to France'—as an auxiliary verb, it 
adds grammatical information to a sentence.
去过法国”——作为助动词，
它为句子添加语法信息。

It's followed by a main verb. You will also see 
this later in the video in sentences like—'I have  
后面跟着一个主要动词。您还将在视频

been studying English for 3 years,' in this 
sentence 'studying' is the main verb. Okay,  
已经学习英语 3 年了，”在这句话

we're doing well, but there's more 
to do. And before we get started  
我们做得很好，但还有更多工作

with how these words are used, we 
need to go over the pronunciation.
关于如何使用这些单词，我们
需要复习一下发音。

'Been' is pronounced, /biːn/ or /bɪn/ or been, 
with a long 'e' sound, been with a short 'e'  
“Been”的发音为 /biːn/ 或 /bɪn/ 或 were，

sound. Both are correct, but /bɪn/ is very 
common and faster, informal speech. It's also  
声音。两者都是正确的，但 /bɪn/ 是非常

very common for speakers to use contractions 
with have, has or had been. For example,  
对于说话者来说，使用缩写词“have”、“has”

I have been often becomes 'I've /biːn/' or 
'I've /bɪn/' with the shorter 'e' sound.
我经常用较短的“e”音变成“I've
/biːn/”或“I've /bɪn/”。

So, listen out for contracted forms—I've, you've,  
因此，请注意缩写形式——“I've”、“you've”，

we've and they've. The same thing happens to 'has 
been' which reduces to /z/ or /s/. For example,  
我们和他们都有。同样的事情也发生在“has

he's been, she's been and it's been. And 'had 
been,' which contracts to /d/. For example,  
他曾经是，她曾经是，而且一直都是。还

I'd been and he'd been. There's an exception 
with the contraction of it had, it had been  
我曾经是，他也曾经是。它的

which contracts to it'd, it'd. Notice the extra 
schwa sound there, which adds an extra syllable.
它与 itd 签订合同，itd。请注意那里额外的
schwa 声音，它增加了一个额外的音节。

It'd, it'd. Finally, we often contract a noun 
with have, has or had been. For example—'The  
是啊，是啊。最后，我们经常用 have、has
或 had been 来缩写名词。例如——“

books have been,' or 'London's been,' or 
'Children had been'. Okay, we're ready for  
书籍曾经是”，或者“伦敦曾经是”，或者

uses. Let's talk about the first and easiest 
use of have been, has been and had been. This  
用途。让我们来谈谈 has was、has 和 had

might be the easiest, but this is where a lot 
of my students get confused and make mistakes.
可能是最简单的，但这就是我的很多
学生感到困惑和犯错误的地方。

We often use have been, has been, and had been 
when talking about travel experiences. For  
在谈论旅行经历时，我们经常使用

example—'Will has been to London many times.' 
This means that Will has visited London many  
例如——“威尔去过伦敦很多次。”  这

times in his life up until now. Note, that it's 
been to London, but it's just visited London  
到目前为止，他生命中的很多次。请注意

without to. That's a common mistake to insert 
a 'to' where it's not wanted after visited.
无需。在访问后不需要的地方插入
“至”是一个常见的错误。

Here's another example—'I've been to 
France3 times.' I have visited France  
另一个例子是“我去过法国
三次。”我去过法国

3 times in my life until now, and I 
might go again in the future. Here  
到目前为止，我一生中已经去过3次了

are some more examples—'Has Verity been to 
Cardiff? Yes, she has been to Cardiff. No,  
还有一些例子——“Verity 去过卡迪夫

she hasn't been to Cardiff.' 'Have you been 
to Australia? Yes I have. No I haven't.'
她还没去过卡迪夫。 “你去过澳大利亚
吗？是的，我有。不，我没有。

So these answers are usually 
shortened to 'yes I have',  
因此，这些答案通常会缩写

'no I haven't'. Please note that we can't talk 
about specific times with have or has been to  
“不，我没有”。请注意，我们不能

talk about general travel experiences. If you 
want to say exactly when something happened,  
谈论一般的旅行经历。如果您想准确

use the past simple. It would be wrong to 
say—'I have been to Australia last year.'
使用一般过去时。说“我去年
去过澳大利亚”是错误的。

It should be—'I went to Australia last year.' 
Now, I'd like to mention something that lots  
应该是——“我去年去了澳大利亚。”

of learners find confusing, have or has 
been versus have or has gone. We use,  
的学习者对“曾经”或“曾经”与“曾经”

have or has been to say that someone 
went to a place and then returned. We  
曾经或曾经说过有人去了一个

use have or has gone to say that someone 
went to a place and has not returned.
使用have或has gone表示某人去了
某个地方但尚未返回。

Look at these examples—'Alisha has been to 
Mumbai.' She went to Mumbai and then she  
看看这些例子——“艾丽莎去过孟买

came back. 'Alisha has gone to Mumbai. She 
will be back next week.' She went to Mumbai  
回来了。 “艾丽莎去了孟买。她

and she is still there. You can also use had 
been when talking about travel experiences.  
她还在那里。当谈论旅行经历

We use 'had been' to say that we travelled or 
didn't travel to a place before another event
我们用“曾经去过”来表示我们在另一
场活动之前去过或没有去过某个地方

in the past. For example—'I had never 
been to the US before I visited New  
在过去。例如，“在访问纽时

York last year.' There are 2 past 
tenses here. I had never been and  
去年约克。”这里有 2 个过去

I visited. Both refer to the past. 
The sentence means that the first  
我参观过。两者都指过去。

time in my life that I visited the US 
was when I went to New York last year.
我一生中访问美国的一次是
去年我去纽约的时候。

Here's another example—'I was excited 
to receive an invitation to their  
这是另一个例子——“我很高兴

wedding in Barcelona. I had been to Spain before,  
在巴塞罗那举行婚礼。我以前去过西班牙，

but only to Madrid.' This sentence means that 
I received the invitation to the wedding in the  
但仅限马德里。这句话的意思

past. I visited Spain at some point before 
I got the invitation, but not Barcelona,  
过去的。在收到邀请之前，我曾访问过

where the wedding was. Okay, we're ready for 
usage number 2—unfinished states and actions.
婚礼在哪里举行。好的，我们准备好
使用 2——未完成的状态和操作。

We use have been and has been in the present 
perfect simple to talk about states that  
我们在现在完成时使用 have been
和 has been 来谈论以下状态：

started in the past and continue up 
to the present. For example—'He has  
从过去开始并持续到现在

been a nurse for almost a year, or—'He 
has been a nurse since last March.' He  
当护士已经快一年了，或者——“他从

started working as a nurse last March 
and has had the job for almost a year.
去年三月开始担任护士，现在
已经工作近一年了。

He is still a nurse now. We use have and has 
been + -ing in the present perfect continuous  
他现在还是一名护士。我们在现在

to talk about actions that started in the past 
and continue up to the present. For example—'I  
谈论从过去开始并持续到现在

have been studying English since 2021,' 2021 
was my starting point for studying English. So,  
从2021年开始学习英语，2021年是

I started in 2021 and I have continued 
for 3 years until the present day.
我从 2021 年开始，至今
已经坚持了 3 年。

You don't know if I will continue studying 
English in the future. Using have been or has  
你不知道我将来是否会继续

been doesn't give you any information about 
the future. We often use the words 'for' and  
ben 不会向您提供任何有关未来的信息

'since' with the present perfect tenses when 
we use 'for', we're talking about the duration  
当我们使用“for”时，“since”与现在完成

of the activity or the period of time. So, 3 
years is how long I have been studying English.
活动或时间段。所以，我
学习英语已经有3年了。

When we say 'since,' we are talking about the 
starting point. So I started studying English  
当我们说“从那时起”时，我们谈论

in 2021. Here are some more example sentences. 
'William has been watching TV since midday.'  
2021 年。这里有更多例句。  “威廉

'William's been watching TV for 3 hours,' 
presuming it's 3 in the afternoon. In the  
“威廉已经看电视 3 个小时了”（

first sentence, William started watching TV 
at midday and he's still watching TV now.  
第一句话，威廉中午开始看电视

In the second sentence, he started watching 
TV 3 hours ago and he is still watching now.
在第二句话中，他 3 小时前开始
看电视，现在还在看。

Another example—'We've been together for 
7 years. We've been together since 2017,  
另一个例子——“我们在一起已经 7 年

so we got together 7 years ago in 
2017 and we are still together now.'  
所以我们在 7 年前的 2017 年就聚在一起

That's actually true. I can't believe 2017 
is seven years ago. Okay, use number 3.  
这确实是真的。我不敢相信 2017 年已经

We're going to take a closer look at 'had 
been'. I'm going to take the sentences that  
我们要仔细看看“曾经是

we used to learn 'have been' and 'has been' 
and show you how they used with 'had been'.
我们曾经学习“have be”和“has be”，并向
您展示它们如何与“had be”一起使用。

And this is going to help you see how the meaning 
changes. Let's start with our sentence about  
这将帮助您了解含义如何变化。

studying English, because it's nice and relevant 
for you. Here it is with 'had been' in the past  
学习英语，因为它很好并且适合

for 3 years when I went to London last year.'  
完美连续。 “去年我去伦敦时，

There are 2 past actions here, one continuous 
past action—'I had been studying English.'
这里有 2 个过去动作，一个是进行中的过去
动作——“我一直在学习英语”。

And a single finished action—'I went 
to London.' Now, I want to compare  
并且只完成一个动作——“我去了
伦敦。”现在，我想比较一下

that sentence with our previous one with 
'have been'. 'I have been studying English  
这句话与我们上一个带有“已经”

for 3 years.' Here, there is one action 
that continues up to the present. We use  
3 年。在这里，有一个动作一直

'had been' or 'had been' + -ing. 
When there are 2 past events,  
“曾经是”或“曾经是”+-ing。  当

the action with 'had been' began in the past and 
continued up to a more recent point in the past.
带有“曾经”的动作开始于过去，
并持续到过去最近的时间点。

We use the past simple to talk about the action 
or event that happened second. In this case,  
我们用一般过去时来谈论其次发生

the more recent point was last year 
when I went to London. We use the  
最近的一点是去年我去

past perfect continuous for the action 
which happened first. We don't know if  
最先发生的动作的过去完成

the action of studying English continued 
beyond the visit to London, but I hope so.
在访问伦敦之后，学习英语的行动
仍在继续，但我希望如此。

Never stopped studying English! I haven't 
stopped studying English. Let's have a look  
从未停止过英语学习！我没有

at the other example sentences and change them

began first and continued until William 
realized it was time to start the housework.  
首先开始，一直持续到威廉意识

另一个例子——“他辞职时已经
当了 11 个月的护士。”

In this case, he became a nurse and continued

because it was having some maintenance and  
上一课我没有戴结婚戒指，

there were rumors. Okay, let's move 
on to the fourth and final use that  
有谣言。好的，让我们继续

I want to talk about in this video of 
have been, has been and had been. They  
我想在这个视频中谈论曾经

are used in the passive voice. So, I buy 
lots of things online for my dog Diego.
用于被动语态。因此，我在网上为
我的狗迭戈购买了很多东西。

And when I complete a purchase, I get an 
email saying—'Your order has been received.'  
当我完成购买时，我会收到一封电子

This sentence is in the passive voice. In the 
active voice, it would be—'We have received  
这句话是被动语态。用主动语态来

your order.' The website uses the passive voice 
because we, the seller, isn't important to this  
你的订单。该网站使用被动语态，

situation. The order is more important, 
so the focus of the sentence is on that.
情况。 顺序更重要，所以
句子的重点就在这里。

After I've bought something, the shop sends 
my purchases to me. I often get a message  
我买完东西后，商店会将我购买的商品

from the courier—notice the pronunciation of 
courier. Courier. With the sound /ˈkʊriə/,  
来自 courier——注意 courier 的发音

I always want to say courier or courier, but 
it's courier. Distracted by pronunciation,  
我一直想说快递或快递，但它

I get a message from the courier 
saying—'Your parcel has been delivered,' or  
我收到快递员发来的消息

because I usually buy several things at 
once—'Your parcels have been delivered.'
因为我通常会同时买几件东西——“
你的包裹已经送达了。”

The parcels are more important than the 
company or person who delivered them,  
包裹比递送包裹的公司

hence the passive voice. So, how do we 
use 'had been' in the passive voice?  
因此是被动语态。那么，我们如何使用

This is quite advanced, but it's important 
that you know it because I'm sure you will  
这是相当先进的，但了解它很

hear it. We use 'had been' in the passive 
voice when there are 2 actions in the past.
听到它。当过去有 2 个动作时，
我们使用被动语态“had was”。

For example—'My van had been repaired by 
the mechanic so it was as good as new.'  
例如，“我的货车已经被机械师修好

Both of the events or actions were 
in the past. The first event that  
这两个事件或动作都已成为

occurred is indicated with 'had been' 
and the second with the past simple. So,  
发生的事情用“had was”表示，第二

first the mechanic repaired my car and then it 
was as good as new. Let's look at another example.
首先，机械师修好了我的车，然后它就
像新的一样。让我们看另一个例子。

I'm not going to explain these uses in 
great detail, but I just want you to

be aware of them. We have 3 to go for. A 
number 1, 'have been' after modal verbs.  
注意他们。我们还有 3 个要去。第一

We see 'have been,' but not 'has been' 
appear after modal verbs like 'might' and  
我们看到“have be”出现在“might”和“might”

'must' using 'have been' with different modal 
verbs could be a whole new video in itself.
将“have be”与不同的情态动词一起使用的“must”
本身就可能是一个全新的视频。

So, here are just a couple of examples.

use 'had been' in the third conditional too.
如果你来的话我会很高兴的。我们也
在第三个条件中使用“had be”。

'If I had been to Greenland before, I 
would have told you about it.' Number  
“如果我以前去过格陵兰岛，我

3—'has-been' as a noun. Can you notice 
anything weird with this one? There is  
3——“过去”作为名词。你能注意

a hyphen between has and been a has-been, 
a noun, is a person who was important,  
has 和 was 之间的连字符 a has-been，

famous, or very good at something 
in the past but isn't anymore.
著名的，或者过去非常擅长
某件事但现在不再了。

It's not a very nice thing to call someone,

That brings me to the end of 
this video. About have been,  
这就是本视频的结尾

has been and had been. There is more to learn 
about these words and the tenses we use them in,  
曾经是并且曾经是。关于这些单词和我们使用

but this has been a really solid 
overview of some common uses.
但这确实对一些常见用途
进行了详细的概述。

Now, let's move on to adverbs. I have 
a video about some of the most useful  
现在，让我们继续讨论副词。我

ones here—'just,' 'already,' 
'still' and 'yet'. Let's go!
这里的——“刚刚”、“已经”、“
仍然”和“还”。我们走吧！

It's already time for another grammar 
lesson. Are you still watching me? Are  
又到了上一节语法课的时间

you not bored of me yet? Did you notice 
that I just—whoops—used already, just,  
你还没厌倦我吗？你有没有注意到我

still and yet in those sentences. Those 
words are the topic of today's lesson  
那些句子中的“仍然”和“然而”。

because they are words that learners 
of English usually struggle with.
因为它们是英语学习者通常
难以理解的单词。

But once you learn them, they are easy to use.
但一旦你学会了它们，它们就很容易使用。

All right, let's get started with the lesson. So,  
好吧，我们开始上课吧。所以，  

you're likely familiar with 
adverbs. These are words that  
您可能熟悉副词

add extra details to verbs. They describe 
verbs—words like slowly, quietly, quickly.
为动词添加额外的细节。它们描述
动词，比如缓慢、安静、快速等。

An example—'I slowly walked through the park.' 
Or—'The little girl sat quietly in her room.' Now,  
举个例子——“我慢慢地走过公园。”  或者

the 4 adverbs that I'm going to discuss with you 
today are a little different. They are adverbs  
我今天要与您讨论的 4 个副词

of time, meaning they generally describe 
when something happens. There are a few  
时间，这意味着它们通常描述某

exceptions and don't worry, we will go through 
those as well. To understand them visually,
例外情况，不用担心，我们也会讨论这些
情况。为了直观地理解它们，

take a look at this timeline. We can see the 
past, now and the future—already and just are  
看看这个时间表。我们可以看到过去

used to talk about actions in the past that are 
finished. They're not ongoing, they're finished,  
用于谈论过去已完成的动作。他们

completed, done. Yet is used to talk about 
things that are planned to happen in the future,  
完成了，完成了。然而用于谈论

and 'still' is the tricky one. It can have 
different meanings depending on the usage.
而“仍然”是一个棘手的问题。根据用途
的不同，它可以具有不同的含义。

These adverbs of time are mostly used 
with the present perfect—have done,  
这些时间副词大多与现在完成

I have done. This is because they're used 
to describe actions that are related to the  
我已经做到了。这是因为它们用于

present in terms of their timing. I'm going to 
give you a couple of examples to demonstrate the  
就其时间安排而言。我将

timing now. With just we have—I've just finished 
my homework. I've just finished my homework.
现在计时。就这样——我刚刚完成了
我的作业。我刚刚做完作业。

I finished my homework a short while ago. With 
already—I've already watched that movie. I've  
我不久前完成了作业。已经——我

already watched that movie. I watched that 
movie some time in the past. So 'just' is a  
已经看过那部电影了。我以前看过

short while ago and 'already' some time in the 
past. It could be a few days ago, it could be  
不久前和“已经”过去的某个时间

a few months ago. We don't know. But what we do 
know is that it happened longer ago than 'just'.
几个月前。我们不知道。但我们确实知道，
这件事发生的时间比“刚刚”早了很多。

I've just watched that movie. I very recently 
watched it. I've already watched that movie,  
我刚刚看过那部电影。我最近看了

a bit further back in time. Let's take a look 
at yet. I haven't been to the supermarket yet.  
时间再往前一点。让我们来

I haven't been to the supermarket yet. This 
means that it's planned, but not done. You've  
我还没去过超市。这意味着它已

planned something, but you haven't done it 
yet. See? Perfect place to use that word.
计划了一些事情，但你还没有做到。
看？使用这个词的完美地方。

And still—I still haven't called my teacher. I 
still haven't called my teacher. In this context,  
然而——我仍然没有给我的老师打电话。

it also means that it's planned but not done. 
This meaning is very similar to the third example,  
这也意味着计划好了但还没有完成
。这个意思和第三个例子很相似，

the previous example. The difference 
is that this implies, the ;still' here,  
前面的例子。不同之处在于，
这意味着，这里的“仍然”，

implies that this action should have already been 
completed, but you still haven't done it yet.
意味着此操作应该已经完成​​，
但您还没有完成。

The 'still' here focuses a little bit more 
on that. You should have already performed  
这里的“静止”更多地关注这

that action, but you still haven't. 
Maybe you've been procrastinating.  
那个动作，但你还没有。  也许

Maybe you downloaded Candy Crush. I did 
that once. I know that's a very old game,  
也许您下载了《糖果粉碎传奇》。我就这么

it's ridiculous. Anyway, moving on. So, we've 
got the basic outline. Let's dive a little  
这太荒谬了。无论如何，继续前进。所以，我们

deeper and look at them as individuals. 
Already, already has 3 basic usages.
更深入地将他们视为个体。  已经
有3个基本用法了。

First, usage—it's used to describe something that 
happened in the near past as we discussed before.  
首先，用法 - 正如我们之前讨论的，

You don't need to wash up. I've already 
done it. I'm very recently washed up. The  
你不需要洗漱。我已经做到

action likely happened several minutes ago. 
Second usage—we use it to describe an action  
行动可能发生在几分钟前。  第二种

that happened longer ago. I don't want to 
travel to Spain. I've already been there,
那是很久以前发生的事了。我不想去
西班牙旅行。我已经去过那里了

that is the biggest lie I've ever said. I always 
want to travel to Spain. In this sentence,  
这是我说过的最大的谎言。我一直想

the meaning of already could be months or 
years in the past. It's much further in  
“already”的意思可能是几个

the past than the first example. The 
third use of already. And this is an  
过去比第一个例子。第三

important one—is to express the idea that 
something happened quicker than expected.
最重要的是表达某事发生
得比预期的要快。

The test started 10 minutes ago, but 
she's already finished it. That is way  
测试十分钟前就开始了，但

quicker than I expected. Maybe the test 
was meant to be 30 or 60 minutes long,  
比我预期的要快。也许测试本来

but the student finished it in 10 minutes. 
This action took place sooner than expected.  
但学生只用了10分钟就完成了。  这

I can't believe you finished it already. Let's 
have a quick test to check your understanding.
我不敢相信你已经完成了。让我们
快速测试一下您的理解情况。

I'm going to show you 2 sentences, and I want 
you to think about the meaning of 'already'  
我要给你们展示两个句子，我想
让你们思考一下“已经”的含义

in that sentence, whether it's the first 
usage, the near past, the second usage,  
在这句话中，无论是第一次使用、

longer ago, or the third usage, quicker 
than expected. First one—I don't want to  
很久以前，或第三次使用，比

see that concert. I've already seen them 
live. I don't want to see that concert.
看那场音乐会。我已经看过他们的现场
表演了。我不想看那场音乐会。

I've already seen them live, 1, 2 or 3?

are correct. Number 2—It's 11:00 am and he's

already eating his lunch. It's 11:00 am and 
he's already eating his lunch. I can relate

发生了一些事情。

However, 'just' can talk about something

最近。 例如——威廉刚从
美国回来。威廉本可以来

I've also got 3 more usages of the word 
'just'. They all have a similar general  
我还有 3 种“只是”这个词的用法

you that I love you. I just wanted

let's move on to these last 2! I mentioned 
earlier that 'still' can be a little bit tricky.

to aim for a B2 level of English. I encourage my 
students who are truly passionate about English,  
以达到 B2 英语水平为目标。我

British culture, the students who want 
to excel—I recommend that they go for the  
英国文化，想要出类拔萃的

C1 level of English. With B2, you 
would be able to work in English,  
英语C1水平。有了 B2，您

but C1 is about reaching that 
level of comfort and relaxation.
但 C1 是为了达到舒适
和放松的程度。

Well, you don't have to reach for words. 
You know them as part of your instinct. So,  
好吧，你不必伸手去寻找言语。  你

let's talk about grammar. 
When you do A1, B1 and B2,  
我们来谈谈语法。  当

you have a lot of grammar to learn. In my 
B1 programme, there is loads of grammar,  
你有很多语法要学。在我的 B1

a big focus on tenses. In B2—there's still a lot 
of grammar. C1 is less about learning entirely new  
重点关注时态。在 B2 中——仍然有很多
语法。 C1 并不是学习全新的内容

grammatical structures, because you should have 
already learned most of that at B2 and below.
语法结构，因为您应该已经在 B2 及
以下级别学习了大部分内容。

Instead, C1 is about learning grammatical nuances, 
so it's adding to your repertoire of phrases and  
相反，C1 是关于学习语法的细微差别，

building your instincts for English grammar. B1 
and B2 are about introducing big new topics. C1  
培养你对英语语法的直觉。 B1 和 B2

is about fine tuning and tweaking. Let's take 
a look at the grammar that you need to know for  
是关于微调和调整。让我们

this C1 level. We'll start with the tenses. If 
you feel ready to study at C1 level in English,  
这个C1级别。我们将从时态开始。

you should already have a strong 
foundation in the English tenses.
您应该已经在英语时态方面
有了扎实的基础。

However, a C1 programme or course will 
provide you with revision of the past,  
然而，C1 课程或课程将为

present, and future tenses with a focus on 
their advanced uses. And this is exactly what  
现在时和将来时，重点关注

we will do in my beautiful British 
English C1 programme. For example,  
我们将在我美丽的英式英语

you should know how to use the future perfect 
tense to make assumptions about the present.  
你应该知道如何使用将来完成

For example—I'm sure my husband will have 
noticed that I used all the milk this morning.
例如，我确信我丈夫会注意到我
今天早上用完了所有的牛奶。

If you're studying at C1, you should also learn 
how to talk about the future using some advanced  
如果您正在 C1 学习，您还应该学习如何

structures, like 'to be set to' and 'to be on 
the verge of', and you need to know when it is  
结构，例如“被设置为”和“处于...的

appropriate to use these structures. Let's move on 
to modals. At C1 level, you should be comfortable  
适合使用这些结构。让我们继续讨论模态框

with using modal verbs, and you should know some 
advanced structures for speculation and deduction.
使用情态动词，您应该了解一些
用于推测和演绎的高级结构。

And you'll also be comfortable with using modal 
verbs with adverbs that collocate with them,  
而且您还会轻松地使用情态动词

like—'They could conceivably have 
driven all that way in one night,  
就像——“可以​​想象，他们可能

but it's unlikely. You'd also know how to 
use structures such as 'the odds are'. Or—'I  
但这不太可能。您还应该知道如何使用

dare say.' For example—I dare say I'll have to 
brush up on my grammar before I do a new course.
敢说。例如，我敢说在学习新
课程之前我必须温习语法。

Conditionals. At C1 level, you should already 
be familiar with the basic conditionals and the  
条件句。在 C1 级别，您应该

mixed conditionals, but when you're at C1, you're 
going to learn about a range of words and phrases  
混合条件句，但是当您达到 C1 时

to replace 'if' and take your conditionals 
to a more advanced level. For example,  
替换“if”并将条件语句提升到

this is quite advanced—But for a wonderful trip 
to Spain when I was younger, I would never have  
这是相当先进的——但对于我年轻时去西班牙

decided to learn the language. Or—Given that 
I'd like to achieve the C1 level of English,
决定学习语言。或者——鉴于
我想达到 C1 英语水平，

I'm going to have to study harder. Can 
you see how it's kind of like B2 on  
我以后一定要更加努力的学习。

steroids—C1? What about the passive 
voice? Again, if you've reached C1,  
类固醇——C1？被动语态怎么样？再

you should be well-versed in how the passive 
voice is used. But at C1 that will be more of  
你应该熟悉被动语态的使用方法
。但在 C1 中，这将更多的是

a focus on using the passive infinitive 
and passive -ing forms. For example—Lucy  
注重使用被动不定式和被动

recalled having been taught about the 
passive voice at some point in the past.
记得在过去的某个时候
曾被教导过被动语态。

You'll also need to learn about the subtle 
differences between phrases like 'there's  
您还需要了解“there’s”等

nothing to do' and 'there's nothing to be 
done', just a subtle difference in meaning  
无事可做”和“无事可做”，

between the 2. But important! You'll also 
need to have a strong understanding of how  
介于 2 之间。但是很重要！

to use negative inversion to add emphasis and 
variation to your writing and your speaking.  
使用否定倒装来强调和变化

Inversion is used widely in literary contexts, 
so understanding this structure will help you to  
倒装在文学语境中被广泛使用
，因此理解这种结构将有助于你

comprehend and analyse a wide range of texts more 
effectively, particularly those with complex or  
更有效地理解和分析各种
文本，特别是那些复杂或

literary styles. For example—Never 
have I seen such a beautiful sunset.
文学风格。例如——我从来没有
见过如此美丽的日落。

Or—Such was the commotion that I can barely hear 
myself think. I love inversion in English. I think  
或者——这种骚动让我几乎听不到自己

it sounds bloody beautiful. Never have I 
come across such a beautiful grammatical  
听起来太美了。我从来没有

structure. Oh, we have to mention hedging 
and boosting! Those who have a C1 level  
结构。哦，我们不得不提到对冲

should be familiar with hedging and 
boosting when writing and speaking.
在写作和演讲时应该
熟悉对冲和提升。

So hedging is a linguistic strategy that allows 
speakers to soften or downplay the force of their  
因此，对冲是一种语言策略，可以

statements, often by using hedging verbs 
like 'to seem,' or the passive voice and  
陈述，通常使用诸如“似乎”

adverbs like 'presumably.' This is something 
we do a lot in British English. Hedging  
像‘大概’这样的副词。这是我们在
英国英语中经常做的事情。对冲

is part of our culture. For example—It 
seems like this might be a good solution.
是我们文化的一部分。例如——看起来
这可能是一个很好的解决方案。

Boosting, on the other hand, involves using 
language to increase the force or impact  
另一方面，提升涉及使用语言

of a statement, often by using adverbs like 
'undeniably' or strong verbs like 'to prove'.  
通常使用“不可否认”等副词

For example—This has been proven to be the 
best solution to our problem. Another really  
例如，这已被证明是解决我们问题

important aspect of achieving a C1 level 
of English is understanding the various

verbs, depending on the context,

希望您觉得本课程有用。

Okay, back to my first love now—pronunciation. 
In the next lesson, you're going to learn  
好吧，现在回到我的初恋——发音

about how to pronounce contractions. We 
use so many contractions in the tenses  
关于如何发音收缩。我们在

from 'I'm' to 'it'd'. Let's listen.
从“我”到“它”。我们来听听。

Oh, this video is a bit of a mix of 
everything. It's going to be about  
哦，这个视频有点混合了

pronunciation and a little bit of grammar too. 
And it's going to help your vocabulary. Today,  
发音和一点语法。  这会对你

we're going to talk about contractions. 
Contractions are perfect for informal  
我们要谈谈宫缩。  缩写

situations. For conversational English, 
native speakers use them all the time.
情况。对于英语会话，以英语
为母语的人一直使用它们。

Today, I'm really going to be focusing on how to 
pronounce them because lots of students struggle  
今天，我真的要重点讨论如何发音

with that. A contraction is when we take 2 words 
and we shorten them into one word. For example,  
与此。缩写是指我们将 2 个单词

I will—I'll. In today's lesson, we are 
going to discuss positive contractions.  
我会——我会。在今天的课程

And maybe in another video, I'll talk 
to you about negative contractions.
也许在另一个视频中，我
会和你谈谈负宫缩。

Let's get started with the lesson! So let's take 
a look at that—I will example again—I'll. You'll  
让我们开始上课吧！那么让我们看一下——

notice that we use the apostrophe to replace 
some missing letters. To form contractions,  
请注意，我们使用撇号来替换一些

we usually combine a verb or auxiliary 
or modal with a pronoun. However,  
我们通常将动词、助词或情态词

there are always exceptions because it's 
English, we just love exceptions. The most  
总有例外，因为这是英语，

common contractions are formed with—am, 
is, are, has, had, and would, will.
常见的缩略语由 am、is、are、has、had、would、will
组成。

So, I think to start, we'll take a look at how to 
pronounce contractions that include the 'be' verb,  
所以，我想首先我们来看看如何

as in—am, is and are. First we have 'I am', 
which is written and pronounced as—I'm,  
如“am”、“is”和“ares”。首先我们有“我

I'm—I'm sorry I'm late. There's so much 
traffic today! We also have—he is. And  
我—很抱歉我迟到了。今天交通太

this can be pronounced in various 
ways. The most common one is—/hiz/.
这可以有多种发音方式。
最常见的是——/hiz/。

You can also hear /his/. That's a very short 
sort of weak form. Sometimes people will even  
您还可以听到/他的/。这是一种非常

drop the 'h' the sound /h/ and they'll say /iz/. 
This is only in certain dialects. Most commonly,  
去掉 /h/ 中的“h”，他们会说 /iz/。  这

you'll hear /hiz/ or /his/. He's at the store. 
He'll be back soon. We also have she is,  
您会听到 /hiz/ 或 /his/。他在商店里。  他

which is pronounced as 'she's'—'she's' 
or the weak form—she's, she's.
发音为“she's”——“she's”或
弱形式——she's, she's。

'She's' the smartest in the group. 'It is' 
is nice and easy. It's pronounced it's,  
“她”是这群人中最聪明的。 “是的

it's. It's not supposed to go in the cupboard. 
It goes in the refrigerator. We also have you're,  
它是。它不应该放在柜子里。  它

you're. And there's another way of 
pronouncing this. You can also say you're,  
你是。还有另一种发音

you're. But 'you're' is a bit simpler, a bit 
easier to say I think. You're right about that.
你是。但我认为“你是”更简单
，更容易说。你是对的。

We also have we are as in we're, we're. 
This can be a tough one to pronounce—we're,  
我们也有我们是，我们是。

we're. We're off to the cinema. See you 
in a few hours. And finally they are,  
是。我们去电影院了。几个小时

makes they're. I know that /eə(r)/ sound 
can be quite challenging too /eə(r)/,  
使他们。我知道 /eə(r)/ 声音

/eə(r)/. Some students find it easy to just 
pronounce the 'e' sound and elongate it.
/eə(r)/。有些学生发现只发“e”
音并将其拉长很容易。

They're still here. Do you want me to get 
them for you? Let's move on and focus on  
他们还在这里。你想让我帮你拿吗

the contractions including has, had and 
have. They can be used as contractions,  
缩写词包括 has、had 和 have。

but only when they are auxiliary verbs. This 
part's really important. We can't use have,  
但仅当它们是助动词时。这部分非常

has, or had as a contraction if it 
is the main verb in the sentence.
has 或 had 作为句子的缩写（如果
它是句子中的主要动词）。

Take a look at these 2 examples. They 
should clarify it for you. I had just  
看看这两个例子。他们应该

heard the news when you called me. 'Had' 
in that sentence is an auxiliary verb.  
你打电话给我时我听到了这个消息
。该句中的“Had”是助动词。

We can use it as a contraction there. I 
just heard the news when you called me,  
我们可以在那里用它作为缩写。当你打

and this next sentence—I had a cup of coffee 
this morning. It's the main verb of the sentence.
下一句话——我今天早上喝了一
杯咖啡。这是句子的主要动词。

We can't contract it—I'd a cup of coffee this 
morning. It just doesn't sound right. I had  
我们不能感染它——今天早上我喝了一

a cup of coffee this morning. Let's take 
a look at 'has' first because it can be  
今天早上喝杯咖啡。让我们先看看

quite confusing. Firstly we have ;she has,' 
she's. 'She's', we also have the weak form,  
相当令人困惑。首先，我们有“她有”，
她是。 “She's”，我们也有弱形式，

'she's'. She says she's been working 
late most nights. We have, he has.
‘她是’。她说她大多数时候都工作
到很晚。我们有，他也有。

He's, he's or the weak form he's. 
He's got a meeting at 10. And finally,  
他是，他是，还是他是弱者。  他

'it has' contracted to 'it's, it's. 
It's been sitting out all night. Now,  
“它已经”缩写为“它是，它是”。

these 3 are confusing because they have the same 
pronunciation and spelling as the contracted  
这 3 个词很容易混淆，因为它们

form of she is, he is and it is. How do you know 
the difference? Well, it should be fairly clear  
她是，他是，它是。你怎么知道其中

from the context, but if you have a doubt, you 
need to see how the sentence has been conjugated.
从上下文来看，但如果你有疑问，
你需要看看句子是如何变化的。

If you can see a past participle after the 
contraction, it means that the contraction  
如果您可以在收缩后看到

represents has. If you see—been, eaten or 
seen, then usually the apostrophe 's' will  
代表有。如果你看到——被、吃掉

be has. Let's take a look at the easier 
ones we have—to have, I have is I've,  
是有。让我们看一下我们拥有的更容易的

I've. I've been here all day. You have 
is you've, you've. You've come all this  
我有。我已经在这里一整天了。你有

way just to break up with me. And we 
have is we've, we've or the weak form
就是为了和我分手。 We’ve 是
we’ve、we’ve 或弱形式

we've. We've taken the dog to the vet. 
And we have had. I had becomes I'd,  
我们有。我们已经带狗去看兽医了。  我们

I'd. I'd been studying English for 3 years 
before moving to Leeds. You had becomes you'd,  
ID。在搬到利兹之前，我已经学习

you'd. You would have passed if you'd studied. She 
had becomes she'd, she'd. She'd been sleeping all  
你会的。如果你学习的话你就会通过。她

day when he called her. He had becomes he'd, 
he'd. He'd left before us but was still late.
他打电话给她的那天。他已经成为他，他
。他比我们先走了，但还是迟到了。

We had becomes we'd, we'd. We'd seen him around 
the office, but we didn't know he was the new  
我们曾经变成了我们，我们。我们在办公室

boss. And they had becomes they'd they'd. 
They'd eaten before coming over. Let's take  
老板。他们已经成为他们的样子。  他们

a look at would, the contractions for would. 
You'll notice they are very similar to the  
看一下“would”，“would”的缩写

contractions for had. I will show you a couple 
of rules after we've covered the pronunciation.
had 的收缩。在我们介绍了发音之后
，我将向您展示一些规则。

I would, I'd—I'd like to visit London. You would,

but the tickets are too expensive. So, how 
do we know if contractions like I'd and  
但门票太贵了。那么，我们如何

we'd are representing had or would? Here 
are some rules to follow. Would is followed  
我们会代表曾经或将会吗？以下
是一些需要遵循的规则。将被关注

by an infinitive. She would go, I would 
love, she'd go, I'd love. Would can also  
由不定式。她会走，我会喜欢，

be followed by the present perfect tense. 
They'd have slept, I'd have given. With.
后面跟现在完成时。  他们
会睡觉，我会付出。和。

had a past participle follows—I'd eaten, 
I had eaten. He'd gotten. He had gotten.  
后面有一个过去分词 - 我吃过，我吃

Let's move on to our penultimate section, 
Will, before we move on to some extra ones.

quite frequently. We have—should have, should've.
相同的模式，但您可能会经常听到它们
。我们有——应该有，应该有。

We can also sometimes pronounce this as

有时我们也可以将其发音为“shouldve”。

should've left much earlier. Would and could 
follow that same pattern. I actually have a  
应该早点离开。会并且可以遵循

video on this, I'll make sure I link it in 
the description box. All about should have,  
有关于此的视频，我会确保将其链接

would have and could have. She would've 
been so angry, they could've come.
将会有并且可以有。他们本来可以
来的，她一定会非常生气。

Finally, we have want to and going to. We 
shorten these wanna and gonna. I have a

要完成这个项目。

want to have some fun? Well, we're gonna!
好吧，你已经取得了很大的进展。你
想玩得开心吗？好吧，我们会的！

We're gonna learn how to use wanna 
and gonna correctly in this video.
在本视频中，我们将学习如何
正确使用 wanna 和 gonna。

I have got a seriously important lesson 
for you today. And this lesson is going  
今天我给你们上了非常重要

to help you understand native speakers 
and sound more native yourself. So,  
帮助您理解母语人士的意思，并让

what are we going to talk about 
today? Well, we're going to talk  
今天我们要讨论什么？

about reductions. I'm going to show you how 
to correctly use words like wanna and gonna.
关于削减。我将向您展示如何正确
使用“wanna”和“gogo”等词语。

I use them all the time in daily conversations. 
It's not "good" English, but it is colloquial,  
我在日常对话中一直使用它们。  这

conversational English—and you will hear 
it—and you probably will want to learn  
会话英语——你会听到它——

to use it. Because saying—'I want to' and 'I'm 
going' to all the time can be pretty tiresome.
使用它。因为一直说“我想要”和
“我要去”可能会很烦人。

So you've probably heard native speakers 
use words like wanna and gonna. Now,  
因此，您可能听说过母语人士使用“wanna”

because it's a colloquial word,
因为它是一个口语词，

there are some variations in spelling. 
I have seen it written wanna,  
拼写上有一些变化。  我

which is what I would tend to use, and 
also wonna, and I've seen gonna and gunna,  
这是我倾向于使用的，也不会，

as well. But the pronunciation 
stays the same wanna, gonna. Not  
以及。但发音保持不

gonna it's gonna not wanna it's wanna. Now, the 
first word that I want to talk about is wanna.
它会不想要它想要。现在，我
想谈的第一个词是想要。

Now, wanna means want to, want to. I 
wanna go home. I want to go home. Now,  
现在，wanna 的意思是想要、想要

this is fine. When we use it with I, you, we and 
they—I wanna go home. You wanna go home? We wanna  
这很好。当我们与我、你、我们和他们一起使用

go home. And they wanna go home. That's fine. The 
problem arises when we want to use he, she or it.
回家吧。他们想回家。没关系。当我们想要
使用他、她或它时，问题就出现了。

Why? Well, because we have to use the third person 
singular. Now, I want to, but she wants to. So,  
为什么？嗯，因为我们必须使用第三人称单数

wanna changes to wansta, wansta. So, he 
wansta go home. She wansta go home. It  
想换成wansta，wansta。所以，他

wansta go home. So you must remember, that if 
it's he, she or it. It's not wanna. It wansta.
想要回家。所以你必须记住，如果是他
、她或它。并不是想要。它想要。

You have to make sure that the 
verb and the subject agree. Now,  
您必须确保动词和主语

moving on to gonna. Gonna means going 
to. And the biggest mistake that I  
继续前进。要去的意思是去

hear is that students forget to use it 
with the verb 'to be'. I am going. You  
听说学生忘记将其与动词“to be”

are going to be going. So I always 
hear, I gonna go. She gonna to go.
将会去。所以我总是听到
，我要去。她要走了。

We gonna do. That's wrong. It needs to be I'm 
gonna go. She's gonna go. We're gonna do. Now,  
我们会做的。那是错误的。必须是我要

the other error that students tend to make with 
gonna is to do with the pronunciation of the third  
学生在使用gongo时容易犯的另一

person singular again. I'm gonna go. You're gonna 
go. We're gonna go. They're gonna go. It's fine.
人再次单数。我要走了。你要走了。我们
要走了。他们要走了。没关系。

But as she and he both finish with a 
vowel sound which is voiced. We need  
但她和他都以浊音元音

to use /z/ sound. She's gonna go. He's 
gonna go. If you want to sound native,  
使用 /z/ 声音。她要走了。他要走

you must do that. If you say she's gonna go 
or he's gonna go. I immediately recognise  
你必须这样做。如果你说她要走

that you're not a native speaker. Of 
course, people will understand you.
你不是母语人士。当然
