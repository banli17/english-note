We usually use this phrasal verb in a negative
sentence, so that's what's happening here.

，所以这就是这里发生的情况。

Her story did not add up.
她的故事不成立。

If you are a student and you go to your teacher
and say, "I'm sorry, I don't have my homework

说：“对不起，我没有作业

finished because last night I got into a car
wreck and I had to go visit my grandmother

，我不得不去看望我的祖母

in the hospital.
在医院里。

老师可能会想，“哦，你的故事，

doesn't add up.

support.
因此，当你支持某人时，你就是在给予他们
支持。

"My parents supported me when I decided to
apply for graduate school."
“当我决定申请研究生院时，我
的父母支持我。”

This is a great example of how a phrasal verb
can directly replace another, maybe more textbook

直接替换另一个，也许更多的教科书

word.
单词。

It's not wrong to say, "My parents supported
me."
“我的父母支持我”这句话并没有错
。

But it's even better to say, "My parents backed
me up when I decided to apply for graduate

This isn't a phrase verb.
这不是一个短语动词。

It's just a bonus phrase that is kind of similar
to this phrasal verb.
这只是一个额外的短语，与这个短语
动词有点相似。

It means, "I will support you.

a little bit risky, well, you can say, "I
